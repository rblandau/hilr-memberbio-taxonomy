,Carol,,Agate,,,,,"175 Harvey St., #7  Cambridge, MA 02140",617-314-3888,carolagate@me.com,,,,,,,"After 35 years of living in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, I retired the end of 2008 and moved to Cambridge where my daughter lives. With almost all my family on the east coast I came home again, slowly relearning how to tolerate the weather. A long-time Unitarian, I belong to First Parish Cambridge. I graduated from Brown in 1955. I then worked in advertising in New York, married, moved to the suburbs, and had what was considered the idyllic life of the 60s: a boy and a girl, a dog and a cat, in the exurb of Westport, CT. After getting the town to remove restrictions on the hours women could play golf on the public course and fighting for Little League to let girls play, I decided to go to law school. Before graduating from UConn Law School, I moved to Los Angeles and finished at UCLA. I worked as a prosecutor, a legal clinic partner, a juvenile traffic judge, a clinical professor at Loyola Law School, and a research attorney to the chief justice of the high court of American Samoa. My final job was an administrative law judge for 21 years. Among my activities have been teaching women and the law to undergraduates at UCLA and USC, and religion and the law at Starr King School for the Ministry. I also taught unemployment insurance classes at the National Judicial College in Reno. I served on the Santa Monica Disabilities Commission and the Westport Zoning Board of Appeals, and am an honorary life member of the Westport Library Board. As an ACLU volunteer I sued Rotary International, resulting in the US Supreme Court requiring Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions to admit women. I have published a number of legal articles and op ed pieces (see this example). New to the Boston area, I soon became involved in the issue of juvenile justice. I also transferred my membership in the Los Angeles chapter of the Hearing Loss Association of America to the Boston chapter and have become involved in their activities. Because there was no cohousing in all of Southern California, the existence of two cohousing communities in Cambridge was another incentive for moving here. During my second year here a unit became available in Cornerstone Village Cohousing, and I'm finding that the community life is all that I had hoped. As much as I miss the weather and friends in Santa Monica, I'm delighted by the move. Cambridge is an exciting place to live, and being near my daughter, granddaughters, sisters, and a few cousins makes it worth starting over. HILR is the icing on the cake.

She remembers vividly the many art exhibits, initiated by Jackson Pollack, in Washington Square Park and seeing Eleanor Roosevelt stride by on her way to her apartment in Washington Mews. Carol attended an all girls' high school and the College of Mt. St. Vincent, a women's college at that time. After graduating, she taught in the South Bronx, one of the happiest teaching experiences of her life. She married and lived in New Haven, where her then husband was a graduate student. They moved to Providence, where Carol received an M.A. in English from Brown, and where her husband was a professor of French. They lived in France with their two children for two years: one year in Aix-en-Provence where her son was born and later in Paris, where her children attended French public school. That same year Carol traveled to Russia to tour and to visit her 'pen pal' of ten years. She found the visit extremely revealing, just as on a later trip to Egypt, she found the current culture interesting as the ancient sites. Carol took some time off to raise her children. Some volunteer activities were initiating a Danforth Fellow university-to-community outreach grant to have black history taught in a public school; she also initiated and implemented a Rhode Island Committee for the Humanities grant for a small press fair under the auspices of the John Russell Bartlett Society. She then taught at the Lincoln School in Providence. She particularly enjoyed directing her students in shortened versions of Shakespearean plays, adapted for children. After that she was a curriculum designer at Brown Medical School and then she was employed as a Senior Environmental Planner, responsible for writing 700-page reports to Congress_thankfully only every two years--and producing educational videos. She also started writing book reviews and food and travel articles for the Providence Journal. In her spare time, she acted in amateur productions at Barker Players, was a debater at the Wednesday Club, and ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate. She taught Italian-American Studies at the Harvard Extension School. She had also taught at the University of Rhode Island, and a class for retirees on Irish-American, Jewish-American and Italian-American literature and film at Salve Regina University in Newport, near Little Compton, where she and her husband Birge (whom she met at a party and they've been having a ball ever since) spend much of the summer. For twenty years, she has been the editor of Italian Americana, a historical and cultural journal. She has written her memoir and edited two books, one an anthology of stories, poetry, and memoirs and the other a book about Italian-American women from immigrant times to the present. Carol's favorite activities are swimming, choral singing, attending theater and opera productions, and spending lots of time with her six grandsons.",,,Art|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Film|French|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|History|Italian|Literature|Medicine|Music|Religion|Social Science|Theatre|Travel|Writing

I've had careers in diplomacy and international business. After Stanford University (wonderful place), I went into the U.S. State Department as an intelligence and information officer on the Korean War under Dean Acheson (superb leadership); then directed those activities at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations during the Cold War; and also negotiated with the North Koreans and Chinese in Panmunjom on a Korean peace treaty. I was an early globalizer in business, leading a paper company (Crown Zellerbach) into international expansion; building networks in Europe, Asia and Latin America for a public relations company (Hill & Knowlton) and its corporate clients; then founding a firm (Allen and Murden) which advised both corporations (Exxon, Ford, Citibank) and governments (Japan, Chile, Organization of American States). Tired of consulting, I became President of Itek International Corporation and directed the expansion of its electronic and optical businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Japan. Then I became Vice Chairman of Boles World Trade Corporation, raised equity capital in London, Geneva, and Saudi Arabia, acquired food and technology trading companies, and ran food, wine and countertrade operations (we sold Napa Valley zinfandel in France). Finally, I went back to consulting with a portfolio of Japanese clients (Foreign Ministry, Bank of Tokyo, Daiichi Pharmaceutical). I moved from New York to Cambridge in 1996 to be near my son Chris (Research Analyst at the Harvard Business School) and my daughter Adrienne (Psychologist at the Linden School in Malden) and five wonderful grandchildren who are blazing new trails in colleges. I discovered HILR (fertile incubator for regenerating lives) and transformed myself into a teacher, an organizer of HILR's intergenerational green revolution, and a fumbling novelist. As someone said, a novel is a long narrative that has something wrong with it -- and mine sure does.

Following college, Alan earned his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago, then taught at Cornell till 1966. In that year, with two children in tow, he and Julie finally reached Boston, where Alan joined the MIT department of political science. In 1969, then-Governor Frank Sargent asked Alan to chair a ""task force"" charged with reviewing the state's highway plans for Greater Boston. To make a long story short, this group concluded that the region needed a new transportation plan, the governor took its advice and asked Alan to direct the new planning effort, and in 1971 he appointed Alan the state's first secretary of transportation. Following this interlude of public service, Alan returned in 1975 to MIT for eight years, during five of which (1977-82) he served as head of the political science department. In 1983 he and Julie moved to New York City, where Alan became dean of the Graduate School of Public Administration (now the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service) at NYU. It was back to Boston, though, in 1988, when Harvard offered Alan its new Ruth and Frank Stanton Chair in Urban Policy and Planning, housed jointly in the Kennedy School and the Graduate School of Design. In the years since, Alan has served variously at Harvard as founding director of the Kennedy School's Taubman Center for State and Local Government (1988-2004), founding director of its Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston (2000-2004), academic dean of the Kennedy School (1993-1995), and dean of the Graduate School of Design (2004-2007). Meanwhile his research and teaching have focused on the politics of urban governance, land use planning, and transportation. Alan took emeritus status at Harvard on July 1, 2013. He looks forward in retirement to spreading his intellectual wings well beyond the specialties that have defined him professionally, to lots of quality time with family and friends, and to enjoying more cultural, travel, and outdoor activities without anxiety about all those commitments waiting back in the office.",,,Climate Change & Ecology|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|Literature|Physical Science|Travel

I went to Hunter College High school and then Cornell University where I met my husband, Alan. We lived in Chicago, Minneapolis and Swarthmore and then spent a year in Uganda with her daughter, Jenny, who was three months old when we went to Kampala. We lived in London for six months and then spent four years in Ithaca New York where Alan was in the Government Department. Our son, David was born in Ithaca. When he was two, we moved to the Boston area so that Alan could teach in the Political Science Department at MIT. (We have lived here since 1966 except for five years in New York City in the 1980's.) We lived near the Ward School in Newton and I worked in the Brookline Public Schools. I was lucky to get a half-time job there and enjoyed very much the professional challenges and time for my young children. I later got a doctorate in Human Development and Reading at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and then worked full-time enjoying the opportunity to develop new skills and enhance my leadership abilities such as they are. The highlights of my career have been teaching and mentoring other people. I like working with others on efforts to bring about positive change. I joined HILR in the fall of 2003. I was the Co-Chair of the Curriculum Committee, a member of the Council and have taught about twelve study groups. HILR has exceeded my expectations in every way. I just wish that I had the time to participate in more of the on-going activities. Our family lives in the Boston area and with five grandsons ranging in age from 13 to 24, there have been many distractions taking me away from HILR. My husband and I spent two winter months in Singapore for three years. We then explored winter life around UCLA. Our oldest grandson is now living in Los Angeles and we want to visit there soon. Last year (2012-2013) we spent part of the winter on Longboat Key, Florida and plan to do so again in 2013-2014 now that my husband Alan has retired from Harvard.

She spent 10 years there and graduated from the University of Miami with a degree in theatre. Continuing her theatrical training at the Arena Stage in Washington, DC under the auspices of a Ford Foundation internship allowed a realistic viewing of theatre life; after one year she decided that the real world was definitely more in keeping with her goals of a balanced family life. Returning to New York City with no experience whatsoever Lillian began teaching in the NYC school system. Completing a graduate degree from Hunter College in Speech and Theatre allowed her to actually teach courses in her field of expertise. In 1972, Lillian moved to Concord, Massachusetts, having recognized instantly that the town offered her everything she ever wanted ___ a good library, historical perspective and a community theatre. Putting down roots with a family and establishing connections with a faith community allowed her to pursue her many interests in all areas of life. Returning to nursing school meant that she could find a way to contribute to nurturing others. Finding a passionate interest in women's issues led to involvement with Massachusetts Friends of Midwives and helping to support the rights of women to choose, where and how they give birth. She has continued to work at Emerson Hospital until this past March. Lillian has always been interested in the Transcendentalists and is now actively pursuing, along with others at First Parish in Concord, developing tours that trace their steps in Italy, France and England.

,Eva,,Arnott,,,,,"8 Lake Street @12  Arlington, Ma. 02474",781-646-2796,evaarnott@comcast.net,,,,,,,"I was born in Vienna to an assimilated Jewish father and non-Jewish mother and became a refugee in Derry, Northern Ireland two years later. I grew up there and in Cardiff, South Wales and met my late husband, Peter Arnott when we were both students at the University of Wales, Bangor. My degree of Joint Honours in English and Philosophy prepared me for a lifetime of reading and ruminating but not for gainful employment. Fortunately this left me free to help with the research and editing of Peter's twenty-odd books, managing the travel schedule for his lectures and marionette performances of his own translations of ancient Greek plays and bringing up our three children. That included many years of teaching Sunday School in an Episcopal and, after we converted, a Catholic church and much time with Brownies, Girl Scouts, Pony Club and 4H. For several years I coordinated a group of women from Winchester who ran a school library under the auspices of School Volunteers for Boston in South Boston during the busing crisis and later at the pre-gentrification Columbia Point. I would sometimes be there one day and in a Winchester school that our own children attended on the next day. The children were so alike and the financial resources that adults devoted to them were so different. In the past decade I've graduated from the Archdiocesan Institute of Ministry, a program to train lay people to do some of the pastoral work previously done by clergy and am very much involved with my parish, St Eulalia's in Winchester. I'm currently a candidate to become an Associate of the Sisters of St Joseph. I'd grown up among Viennese refugees who constantly discussed what had caused the destruction of their pre-1914 Arcadia which had been benignly overseen by the Emperor Franz Joseph whose portrait hung in all their living rooms. With this sad example in mind I've tried to learn about how our own relatively stable society works.

Years later, responding to stimuli unnoted by others, Clark resumed his formal education at Harvard's Extension School, from which in time he received a Master of Liberal Arts degree.

Clark has since served as a ""section leader"" in Extension classes on baseball as a mirror of American society and WW II as seen through literature and film.

I belong to an a cappella singing group in Newton, and enjoy exploring early music, a rich resource here in the Boston area. I enjoy classes on early music. During the summers I am a practicing organic farmer at my house in Maine, so I am interested in classes on ecology and the environment. Languages, both alive and dead, are also interesting and I participate in the tavola Italiana, a group to speak Italian.",,,Climate Change & Ecology|Music|Physical Science|Social Science|Technology|Travel
,Michael,,Bliss,,,,,"13 Barberry Road  Lexington, MA 02421",508-878-7360,mbliss@rcn.com,,,,,,,"Michael Bliss is a recently retired lawyer and former English professor. He grew up on Long Island, attended a Quaker secondary school there and graduated from Dartmouth College. After college he studied at Claremont Graduate School, taught English at Tufts, earned a Ph.D. at Harvard, taught English at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and married and had a son. In the late 70's he drew a line under his academic/Pittsburgh life_he and his wife had then separated and were later divorced_by moving to Boston and beginning law school at Boston University Law School. After law school he practiced at Choate, Hall and Stewart and later at Sullivan & Worcester. He specialized in land use and environmental law_a specialization that he maintained for his legal career of more than thirty years. In 1996 he left the big law firm world and established a small firm_Connors & Bliss (with former HILR member Don Connors) focusing on land use and environmental law. During these years he married again_to a wonderful young English woman_and had two sons. During his years of legal practice he came to see that his two different careers were not so different after all; at the heart of each was the English language and the challenge of saying precisely what needed to be said. Seven years ago he and his wife sold the Victorian house in Natick where they had raised their sons and downsized to a small modernist house in Lexington (for aficionados of 1950's architecture, in Five Fields). This move brought with it the need to landscape a three-quarter acre lot, which when they moved in was a blank canvas. He went into this_call it gardening, landscaping or simply working with plants_hammer and tongs; he has found both the knowledge and the landscape he has achieved deeply satisfying.

He also provided legal services to clients in other areas such as high technology, sports, and health care. He has served as a Board director of two banks and he has represented underwriters in a number of public offerings of securities. Growing up in the South, Gene graduated from the University of Virginia where he majored in Mathematics, took all of the English courses he could work into his schedule, edited the student literary magazine and developed a lifelong interest in Thomas Jefferson. He then graduated Harvard Law School. At Harvard, other than meeting and marrying his wife, Gene pretty much stuck to studying law. After a brief period in Washington, DC, he and his wife returned to Boston. As General Counsel to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, Gene wrote chapters on the US legal system for two textbooks used in the education of nurse anesthetists as well as a column for the Association's bi-monthly journal, often highlighting a recent case on a legal principle involving a nurse anesthetist. Surveys conducted for advertisers in the journal consistently ranked Gene's column as the most widely read article in the Journal.

During her career she helped educate nursing students at the baccalaureate level and has developed many courses and workshops related to psychiatric-mental health nursing. Her first academic appointment was at the Neuropsychiatric Institute of the University of Michigan as supervisor and instructor of nursing followed by a faculty position at the University of Delaware where she taught for almost two decades. During this period Elaine enrolled in many literature courses for both personal pleasure and professional reasons. This shift in educational focus was largely motivated because she saw a gap between her students' science and humanities course requirements and wanted to bridge this by introducing literary characters and scenarios into her lectures and seminars to more clearly illustrate concepts of health, illness, and coping relevant to nursing. After retirement as associate professor, Elaine began a period of extensive travel with her husband, now deceased. A trip to Turkey left her with an abiding interest in Sufi poetry.

,Natalie,,Camper,,,,,"1550 Beacon Street Apt. 9B  Brookline, MA. 02446",617-232-2260,camper.natalie@gmail.com,,,,,,,"Born and brought up in Brooklyn, New York, Natalie graduated from high school, married, had three children, and then became a college student, taking one course at a time because her infant daughter was only two months old. Next to her children, Natalie considers the six years it took her to earn her Bachelor's degree in English and Education among the most satisfying years of her life. Because of her husband's illness, Natalie and her family moved to Miami, Florida. It was 1963--an auspicious year for women--virtually the re-birth of the feminist movement. Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique had just been published; consciousness-raising groups escalated and women began returning to school by the thousands. Natalie started an organization for re-entry women at her college to help women feel welcome as an integral part of the student body. One of the ways she did this was by holding three major meetings a year at the school with the college President and several Deans who spoke to the audience about what the school had to offer them and to assure them that they were welcomed by the whole college community. Before graduating in 1969, Natalie received an offer to teach and to be an administrator at an innovative new high school in North Miami Beach. At first the city's wealthy parents were excited by the principal's ideas; later, however, they became disillusioned. The parents balked at the many freedoms their children enjoyed, at their ability to select their own classes and teachers, and at interdisciplinary courses the parents did not understand. They were determined that their youngsters were going to attend Ivy League schools and that this high school would be an impediment to that goal. Parents were also determined to have the principal and superintendent of schools fired. They succeeded. Traditional counterparts took their place; the school became sterile. And, despite being tenured, Natalie resigned. So, too, did several other educators. It seemed the right time to get her Masters degree. She hoped to have an impact on how teachers were educated and decided that the way to do this was to teach future teachers. Her goals were to help student teachers recognize that they lived in a global community with all that this implies. Her second goal was to encourage them to question the authority of textbooks. Natalie's thesis outlined a five-year curriculum that would include world history, geography, anthropology, and literary components. In addition, there would be a mandatory requirement for students to study at least two languages, one of them from a country whose language was seldom studied at that time, e.g., Chinese, Arabic, a Slavic language. Her Masters thesis: Teacher Education for World Citizenship. Natalie and her family moved to Boston after she graduated. She enrolled at Boston College for her Ph.D., majoring in the History and Philosophy of Education. She had always wanted to demonstrate the direct correlation between the political leadership of a nation and its educational system, using Cuba as an example because of its size, proximity to the United States, and her modest Spanish language skills. She visited that country several times, researched their educational history, and Cuba's historical relationships with Spain and the United States, particularly under its two most recent presidents. Disserta-tion: Cuba's Post-Revolutionary Work-Study Education, 1959-1975: History, Ideology and Implementation. After receiving her doctorate in 1979, Natalie found it difficult to find a teaching position at the university level in Massachusetts. Not wanting to relocate her children, she took a job with John Hancock in its Education Department. Five years later she left to became an outplacement counselor for Drake Beam Morin and later she worked for the largest executive search firm in the world. It was her last position as an employee. As a single parent, with her two sons safely launched in satisfying careers, and with only her teen-aged daughter to support, Natalie decided to become an independent manage-ment consultant, focusing on communication in organizations. Within several months, Natalie's plans were interrupted almost abruptly. It was 1981 and the media was saturated with compelling testimony as the Senate debated whether to confirm Clarence Thomas as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual harassment brought against him. Natalie was transfixed by the ""he said/she said"" complexities of the issues raised; she viewed her own burgeoning consulting practice in light of what she learned from this case. Could she, indeed, become knowledgeable enough to consult with corporations and law firms on sexual harassment cases? She decided to try. Six months later she found herself coaching individuals and conducting seminars for a wide array of organizations. Her firm flourished for almost twenty years--until 2008 when the country's financial crisis hit her consulting practice hard. Several of Natalie's smaller clients went out of business and the larger companies foundered badly. Now, growing older herself, and considering retirement, Natalie thought a lot about the issues facing by other older people. Fascinated by the convergence of the aging 78 million Baby Boomers, new knowledge of the brain's plasticity, about what fMRI's and CT scans reveal, about the huge leaps of medical sciences' discoveries, about the expectation that older people will live 20-30 years longer than any previous generation, and about all these Americans coming of old age in a society obsessed with youth. As a result, Natalie decided to offer her services as a life coach and seminar leader to individuals and to groups of Baby Boomers and Echo Boomers, the latter already anxiously anticipating their own aging. Now, almost entirelly retired, Natalie continues to conduct research about older people and is writing articles and short stories about what it means to grow old gracefully.",,,Business|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|History|Literature|Medicine|Philosophy|Social Science|Spanish|Travel|Writing

Carlisle has recently retired, currently Professor Emerita in the School of Education, University of Michigan. Her BA degree in English from Vassar College and love of reading led her to a life-long interest in language and literacy. A particular focus of her work has been children for whom learning to read and write presents unusual challenges. Her interest in teaching and learning contributed to research focused on characteristics of effective instruction in reading, assessment of teachers' knowledge about reading, children's language development, and web-based opportunities for teachers to study reading instruction. She has served (and continues to serve) as a consultant for organizations working on issues of early literacy and language development. Joanne and her husband (C. Addison Stone) moved to Cambridge in 2012 to be near their sons and their families and reasonably near their second home in the northwest corner of Connecticut. While she continues her professional work as researcher and consultant, she also volunteers at Boston Children's Hospital.

First, he practiced law and supervised attorneys in several venues including three federal agencies in Washington DC: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and, starting in 1986, the Environmental Protection Agency. Finding that the affairs of nature were far closer to his heart than the affairs of men (and women), Fred went back to school at George Mason University to become a biologist also starting in 1986. He focused on environmental and marine science and graduated with an M.S. in environmental biology in 1994. By that time, Fred had moved into EPA's hazardous waste program office where, among other roles, he was Branch Chief for EPA's hazardous waste treatment and and disposal program. In 2000, at age 52, Fred left EPA and began the third chapter -- his true ""dream job"" of teaching high school science. During his 12-year teaching career at a private school in northern Virginia, he served as science department coordinator and introduced courses in AP Environmental Science, marine science, and earth science, Fred also brought advanced molecular genetics lab studies into the biology curriculum. Fred led field trips to study coral reefs in the Bahamas, coastal ecology on the Outer Banks, and marine science at William and Mary's coastal research station. He also mentored many students as their sophomore and senior class dean. In 1981 while at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Fred met Elisa Grammer, his wife of 32 years (still going strong!). They raised two sons in Northern Virginia and, after the youngest entered college in 2012, he and Elisa retired to West Newbury on the north shore of Massachusetts. Fred has become a member of the West Newbury energy advisory committee and recently authored its five-year energy reduction plan as part of West Newbury's effort to be certified as a Massachusetts Green Community. Fred and Elisa love the country life on the North Shore and are also enjoying their new role as commuting-to-Montana grandparents. Fred continues to stay in contact with many former students, and his passions still lie in the sciences and teaching. He looks forward to exploring these passions and to expanding into new areas with HILR. Achieving greater social justice and preparing young adults to take over from aging '60s hippies remain at the core of his lifelong pursuits.",,,Biological Science|Business|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Climate Change & Ecology|Computer science|Economics|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|Music|Physical Science|Religion|Social Science

She has taken a vast range of classes in parallel to her Administrative careers at Boston University, Children's Hospital and a long stint as Director of Student Financial Services at Harvard's Extension School. Cheryl received her AA degree at Lasell College in Newton concentrating in Middle Eastern History and taking electives in Art and Music History as well as Eastern and Western Philosophy, Eastern Religion and Creative Writing. She received her BA in American History from The College of the Holy Cross where she was one of seventeen women in its first co-educational class. With hundreds of males as her classmates and a pleasant distraction, it was sometimes difficult to keep her nose to the grindstone! While working at BU she enrolled in the Program in Artisanry and spent her evenings laboring in the exotic woodworking shop learning a reverence for wood and the craftsmanship and art that shaped it. One small table still survives in the downstairs hall of her home. After woodworking came endeavors in Women's Studies and Therapeutic, Abnormal and Interpersonal Psychology. Looking for something more job related, she took several courses in Accounting; a chore to be sure, but more practical. On to the Medical Area and total immersion in computers and related technology. The small technical crew who worked at the Gait Analysis Lab of Children's Hospital had become very close and eventually moved en masse to what Bob Dylan called the green pastures of Harvard and Cheryl moved with them. Her career in dealing with organizational and student finance began there in the Computer Science Department. Moving on to the Extension School she was promoted to Director of Student Financial Services until leaving to care for her elderly parents. While at the Extension School she earned her Ed.M in Educational Administration from Harvard's Graduate School of Education. Taking care of her parents was hard work but a labor of love. While doing this, Cheryl decided to move in a new educational direction and continued her studies by enrolling in The Landscape Design program of the Radcliffe Institute. She finished all but her final project designing a Japanese garden in the wilderness of her mother-in-law's property but continues to be an avid gardener in her own yard and as a volunteer at Habitat in Belmont and at the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. For the last twenty two years Cheryl has traveled extensively with her husband Scott, coming to appreciate especially the Southwest of the United States and the culture and history of the Anasazi Indians. They have made several trips to her beloved Great Britain and Ireland as well as numerous places in Europe and the Caribbean. Currently she devotes her time to writing, meeting weekly with a writing group at the Hi -Rise Bakery on Brattle Street and stoically accepting rejections from short story journals and NPR.

It was while teaching at Bates that she wondered what it meant that almost nothing she read each morning in The New York Times had anything to do with how she spent the rest of her day. It was also during this restless period that she realized that as a specialist in Victorian literature, she almost never read living authors. When a colleague noted that ""when Jo Ann says 'the '60s' she is referring to the 1860s,"" Citron decided it was time to make a change. Trading texts for torts, she went to law school, passed a couple bar exams, and began reading living authors. Fortune smiled and she found a dream job with a small civil rights firm that concentrated in police misconduct litigation. (Jo Ann spent a fair amount of time behind the wheel during those years hoping that if she got pulled over it wouldn't be by one of the cops she was suing.) After she'd practiced law for about a decade, Jo Ann found the academic life calling to her again, more sweetly this time for having nothing to do with tenure. Her work for the Women's Review of Books helped to win her a spot as Visiting Research Scholar at the Center for Research on Women at Wellesley College, and following the expiration of her term there, she was offered a part-time position in the Women's Studies Department at the College where for several years she taught a course on the law, the family, and the state. Before her swerve into law, Citron had been interested in how Jane Austen became Anthony Trollope. These days she'd be litigating that as a sexual reassignment case, but back then she was interested in how courtship gave way to marriage as a fit subject for the Victorian novel, and in how contemporary law reform made its way into narratives about family. Suddenly she was teaching the law and public policy of family formation and dissolution. And that was when she had her ""aha!"" moment and became a family law attorney. Citron Law united legal practice with the intellectual work that the recovering academic had long mourned the loss of (if deconstruction had taught her anything at all, it was how to make ""divorce"" mean ""marriage"" ). Eventually, the stress of high-conflict custody litigation took its toll and she decided that it was time to retire. She now divides her time between Cambridge and Truro, riding her bike, reading authors (alive and dead) and getting sucked into the Nordic noir craze.",,,Civil Rights & Social Justice|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|Literature

Her career began with a dual appointment as a museum educator and university instructor of art history in Toledo, Ohio. After marrying, she moved to Iowa. There she taught classes in art history for the town's new art museum and established its first docent (volunteer guides) program. When the family moved first to western Massachusetts, and then to the Boston area Shirley returned to teaching in academic settings finaly retiiring from Northeastern University. During a hiatus from teaching, Shirley went back to school. At the Episcopal Divinity School she studied theology in order to create a stronger basis for her interest in the connections between art and theology graduatingl in 1991. Soon after that she became (and remains) a docent at the Harvard Art Museum where she developed a new passion_Asian art. This has been a focus since about 2000 with travel, reading, study of the collections at Harvard & the MFA, as well as the study of Buddhism.

In the following 18 years, Patrick and his family moved to seven different states, nine different towns, and six different schools. In 1967, Patrick came to Cambridge to attend MIT, and has gratefully lived here since. As an undergraduate, he was against the war, for social justice, and interested in the ""free school"" movement of the late 60s. He helped found and teach in an all-volunteer free high school, where he met Judy Lazrus, who became the love of his life and his future wife. After graduating from MIT, discovered that he loved working with young children. In the years that followed, he taught in settings as diverse as a mental health center, a parent-run cooperative, and a Montessori School. He picked up two additional degrees; a MA from the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study at Tufts University, and a CAS from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. His family grew to four with two daughters, the younger one adopted from Paraguay. He then began working in the Cambridge Public Schools, as a kindergarten teacher in the Follow Through Program (created as an extension of the Federal Headstart Program) and then as a classroom teacher in a combined first-second grade at an alternative public school, the Cambridgeport School, where he spent the next 20 years teaching first and second graders. In 2010, on the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Cambridgeport School, Patrick retired from teaching. A memorial to his years at Cambridgeport is a plaque outside his classroom celebrating his love of raising monarch butterflies, which he shared every year with the school staff and students. Patrick is looking forward to sharing his butterfly lore, along with his other interests, as a part of the HILR community. He has kept up his first love of science and technology, and keeps abreast of developments in cosmology, extra-solar discoveries, paleontology, archaeology, green technology, and geeky gadgets. He loves gardening, bicycling, dismantling and repairing mechanical devices, and ""ponding."" He reads ancient history, classical literature, cyberpunk science fiction, and a smattering of philosophy and religion. A yoga practitioner, he is interested in learning about meditation.

Having descended from a long line of distinguished linguists and chemists, I majored in biochemistry in college, but quickly found that I lacked the brains to succeed in academia. I was taken under the wing of a wonderful man who ran an engineering firm and quickly rose through the ranks, but having no formal background in engineering I decided to use my get out of jail free card and go to business school. Continuing my lack of direction after my MBA, I fell into a banking job at First National Bank of Boston which I loved but was mistakenly hired away by the founders of a venture capital firm, Battery Ventures. There, newly married with a small child, I realized I had to make it work because no one would hire a failed venture capitalist. Fortunately, the market gods smiled upon the field of venture capital and we were successful in spite of ourselves. In 2005, after twenty years at Battery Ventures I retired, turning things over to all the youngsters who were smarter and more ambitious than me and who had learned all my tricks. My transition to retirement was difficult and included much flailing around with failed ventures in China, but I finally learned to slow down and found my calling when I joined HILR in 2015.

In addition to her thirty-five plus years of teaching at Simmons, she has conducted a private practice of psychotherapy and continues to see a small number of clients. Because she wanted to work with a diverse patient population and have experiences closer to those of her social work students, she also volunteered at the South End Community Health Center from 1998n- 2008.

She grew up in New Hampshire, happily immersed in family and pets and books upon books upon books. She went off to Bennington planning to become a poet and starve in a garret; managed to get married, divorced, and investigated by the FBI; built a log cabin, got a degree in zoology from UNH, and headed to Princeton as a graduate student. There this old woman of 25 met a third year graduate student named Frank Wilczek, who was just a few weeks past his 2!st birthday. They recently celebrated their 36th wedding anniversary and have two grown-up daughters, both living nearby. Betsy has a master's degree in engineering from Princeton and many years of engagement with computers and people who love them. With her husband she co-authored Longing for the Harmonies, a popular-science introduction published by WW Norton. She has also enjoyed many real-life community projects including creating a newsletter for Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study and captaining their softball team, the Princeton Eulers. The softball team led to her second published book, when a funny pamphlet she dot-matrix-printed as a team fundraiser became the kernel of Absolute Zero Gravity, a science-joke collection published by Simon and Schuster. Since moving to Cambridge in 2000, she has been increasingly drawn into local internet communities. Inspired by the first meeting of Harvard bloggers, convened in 2003, Betsy soon found herself employed as company blogger-cum-troubleshooter for an RSS search engine company.

Except for two years living in Bethesda while I was doing biochemical pharmacology research at the National Institutes of Health, we have lived in Cambridge since 1966. Most of my medical career was at Mount Auburn Hospital where I founded and directed the Primary Care Center, a hospital based group practice that is a training site for residents. Additionally, for many years I taught students at Harvard Medical School and continued to teach after stepping down from my Mount Auburn Hospital position. As a child, I played the violin and attended the High School of Music and Art. I stopped playing a couple of years after high school but in recent years I have taken up and tried to learn (with the difficulties of taking up a new instrument as an adult) the piano. Whatever challenges that I have experienced playing instruments, I have always been an avid listener of music and attendee at concerts. Joan Sheingold Ditzion and I have been married since 1967. She is a social worker and is a founder of Our Bodies, Ourselves. She has written parts of each of the editions as well as other works concerning feminism and intergenerational relationships. We have two married adult sons and daughters in law who live in Boston and Brookline, and three very young grandchildren with whom we spend a lot of time and are very much the centers of our lives.

She now enjoys the ideal situation of living across the street from her daughter's family: close enough to happily interact every day, far enough to escape the tumult. Since arriving in Cambridge Judy has become a weekly volunteer at Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic; assists seniors with college applications and tutors ESL students in writing at Cambridge Rindge & Latin HS; participates in a weekly French conversation circle; and has served on the board of the Friends of the Cambridge Library.

In memory of Eric Kurtz I am expanding my bio. I knew I wanted to be a social worker when I was still in high school. That was during WWII and high school students were encouraged to voluneer in various places to help out the war effort. I was assigned to an agency in Philadelphia (Herb Epstein was in charge of making assignments). It was called the Nicetown Boys and Girls club. There I ran an activity program for kids,I found I liked that kind of work. The Director told me i could become a social worker ( who ever heard of that in 1942?) and that I should get a masters Degree. So I went to college(University of Pennsylvania) with that in mind. When I graduated in 1947, I went directly to what was then called the New York School of Social Work - now the Columbia U. School of Social Work. When I graduated, I went to work for the Girl Scouts of Philadelphia and Herb and I were married a short time later. We had four children, from 1952 to 1958, and I worked part time for many years. When Herb was transferred to Ford Motor Co. in Detroit in 1975, I went to work full time for the first time since 1952. I was the Director of Social work for the Jewish Home for Aged of Detroit.

Goethe Dick Evans grew up in the Boston area and southeastern Vermont. He graduated from Boston University with a BFA degree and Harvard University with a EdM degree. He has worked in retailing, industry, professional services, and higher education. In much of this work he has concentrated his efforts to bringing human resources to a more valued place in the life of organizations. As a corporate director, management consultant, a university lecturer he celebrated the human side of organizational life. The range of organizational involvement spanned small family owned operations to large publically traded conglomerates. Some were for profit and others were non profit. Some were local and others international. However, they all had to wrestle with their human capital and solve people problems and issues. In his retirement that work continues as he is pursuing research in human resources management and serving on an advisory committee to the Board of Selectmen in the community where he lives. His recent retirement has allowed the Dick to follow his late acquired passion for golf. When the weather permits one is likely to find him at a golf course attempting to become competent at this impossible sport. Spurred on by hitting a hole-in-one in his first five years playing he is now competing in several golf leagues. This activity is encouraged by his wife who is a very experienced and enthusiastic golfer, herself. They are frequently on the links together.

Learning of her wedding plans, the college informed her that the school did not accept married students and if she continued with her plans she would not be allowed to return to school in September. With two years of college complete, she withdrew from college and was married in the summer of 1964. It was while visiting colleges with her oldest daughter she decided it was time to look into completing her own degree. After four years of evening classes and a summer session she received her diploma in 1985, a B.A., magna cum laude, with a major in Russian Area Studies. In the audience, acknowledging her accomplishment, were her husband and five children. The years leading up to the return to school were filled with various community volunteer activities: member of the Briarcliff (NY)Library Board of Trustees and Children's Program Coordinator; Girl Scout leader and coordinator of community Scouting activities; volunteering in the schools, working with the PTA including serving as President, and chairing the School Board committee to explore a full day kindergarten program In 1989 she moved to Dutchess County New York where her volunteer activities continued as Chair of the Town Zoning Update Committee, and member of the Dutchess County Historical Society Board of Directors and Children's Program Coordinator. At this time the opportunity to put much of the experience and skills gained through volunteer activities to work presented itself and Katie went to work, part-time, in a private school that was trying to develop and strengthen its library program. With limited funding, volunteers were trained and the collection was updated to support each grade level curriculum. Trained as a Junior Great Books Leader, she initiated a program with a group of 7th and 8th graders meeting during their lunch break. This was an especially rewarding experience for Katie and she is particularly pleased when she hears how the program continues to thrive. When Katie and her husband moved to Ocean County New Jersey she was employed as Executive Director of a start-up Big Brothers Big Sisters Program. She was starting with the basics: completing the documentation required for final approval from the national organization, preparing a policy and procedures manual, setting up an office, hiring a staff, and developing media relationships so important to the new organization. Within the year, a strong program was underway with close to 30 children in the program and outreach was expanded to a school-based mentoring program. Volunteer activities continued with membership on various United Way committees. Katie then moved on to serve as Executive Director of Contact We Care, a crisis hotline that also responded to the national 1-800-SUICIDE line. With a staff of six and 100 trained volunteers, the hotline telephones were answered 24/7/365. She frequently answered the hotline which served as a continual reminder of the importance of this agency. Katie and her husband moved to the Boston area in 2010.

Three years later, his family spent a year in Egypt before moving to France. They emigrated to New York in 1952, went to Panama and came back a year later. He attended high school in Sedona, AZ, long before it became a new age/retirement community. From the solitudes of dramatic scenery and the community of very small classes, he went to Harvard and then its School of Design. After marrying Bonnie in 1968, he worked for a year designing schools before going to MIT in city planning. There was no work for architects or city planners when he graduated in 1972 and his next job was writing the then brand new environmental impact statements for many projects in and around Boston. A decade later, he was managing the 2020 state-wide water supply study and the series of environmental reports that cleared the way for the Big Dig. In 1984, he became planning director for Massport. He helped integrate the Big Dig Artery-Tunnel project and identified sea level rise as a problem. Eight years later the political winds changed and he was out of the public sector. For the next 10 years, he managed roadway, rail, and ferry design/impact studies in the Northeast for an international engineering firm as well as overseas airport studies. As one of his three children pointed out, he was being sent where Americans weren't supposed to go, but it was fine. The recession that followed 9/11 found him doing development and traffic studies in Boston neighborhoods, South Shore, and Cape Cod communities. In 2007, he developed amyloidosis and the two year convalescence from chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant led him to retire. Now, he writes fiction, discusses books and ideas, takes photos, tinkers with inventions, and looks forward to biking and visiting grandchildren again.

,Donald,,Geffen,,,,,  ,,geffe005@umn.edu,,,,,,,"Growing up in Brooklyn during the years of Depression and War, Don benefited from the excellent educational opportunities that existed in New York at that time, starting with kindergarten and ending with a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics at City College of New York ___ all tuition free. Four years later, he received a Ph D in theoretical physics at MIT and, while there, discovered the many charms of the Boston area. He spent the following six postdoctoral years at a number of research centers starting with the theoretical physics group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, followed by Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, and the last two years in Europe, thanks to a National Science Foundation Fellowship. The first year of the Fellowship was spent at the large European center for high energy research, CERN in Geneva. His second year was spent at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. Encouraged by enthusiastic tales about life in Minneapolis told by a colleague at the Institute and his wife, Don decided to accept a position at the University of Minnesota. He remained at the University of Minnesota for twenty two years, a good majority of those years as a full professor. He taught both undergraduates and graduate students and did research in theoretical high energy particle physics. By the late 1970s, however, Don became interested in the financial markets and as the 1980s unfolded, he looked ahead at what seemed to be a bear market in academia but a long term bull market in equities. Don left the university and started a career in money management for a large investment management firm with offices in Minneapolis. This opportunity enabled him to make use of his interest in economics and politics as well as his mathematical and analytical capabilities. Approaching retirement age, Don left the investment business and pursued a growing interest in environmental issues. Along with a professor at the University of Minnesota's business school and a professor at the department of health sciences, Don became engaged in a multi-year project to explore better ways of environmental regulation in Minnesota. The Clinton Administration had a similar goal and the Minnesota project eventually joined the national effort which was part of the Administration's general theme of ""Reinventing Government."" The environmental component of this was known as Project XL and Don's group, with EPA funding, both participated in and evaluated XL with a particular focus on the effort to design a pilot project at 3M's flagship facility in Minnesota. The work resulted in several articles and culminated in a book which tells of the birth and death of Project XL, analyzes the process, and discusses why, in the end, despite some improvements in how pollution is regulated, it failed in its efforts at major change. After 43 years living in Minneapolis, Don and his wife Binny moved south to Back Bay in Boston. Although they left a son living in Minneapolis, the move brought them closer to their daughter, who, along with her husband own and run Red Sky Restaurant in Southwest Harbor, Maine. Minneapolis did have many advantages, however. While living there, the city became a vibrant cultural center. Binny worked in the educational department of the Walker Art Center for several years and ran the tour program. In addition, she earned an MA in Art History at the University of Minnesota. When the Guthrie Theater opened, Don, as chairman of the Walker Art Center's Jazz Committee (a volunteer group), produced the first concerts at the new theater, bringing to Minneapolis many of the great jazz musicians of the time.

He first crossed the Mason-Dixon Line when he went to Yale. He majored in Mechanical Engineering, but stayed an extra year to indulge courses in history of art and French literature, long and late discussions, and sherry with Sloan Coffin, the liberal Yale chaplain. His career as an engineer, for Standard Oil of California, lasted only a year. His idealism and restlessness led him to teach secondary school in Ghana for two years. Chuck thought a career in international development would benefit from training in business management. He went to Harvard Business School. While there he met Joanne Fay, a native of Wellesley. They were married after he took a job with the Ford Foundation in Mexico City. His mentors suggested he go back and study more. (Perhaps he was a slow learner after all.) The couple returned to Cambridge where they began their family and he got a PhD in organizational behavior at the MIT Sloan School. When Chuck had to go to work again, the Gibsons decided against further trying to save the world. They settled in Concord. He joined the faculty at HBS, where he taught MBA's and middle-level managers and helped develop the new field of information systems management. He co-authored ""Managing the Four Stages of EDP Growth"" , Harvard Business Review, wrote Managing Organizational Behavior, text and cases, and researched the impact of new information systems on organizations and people. Most of all, in teaching by the case method Chuck found his calling. After nine years at HBS Chuck moved to Index Systems, an IT and management consulting firm in Cambridge. He continued case teaching, in customized programs for client companies. He learned more about introducing change to an established management culture. He had to practice what he preached. He came to value the pragmatic, as opposed to the ideological. After seventeen years at Index Chuck made his first attempt at retirement. It was a failure. He returned to academia. For twelve years at MIT he worked at the Center for Information Systems Research in the Sloan School. In 2011 Chuck is making a second try at retirement. He is consulting to MIT and does some work in Latin America, where he dredges up very rusty Spanish. He is on two company advisory boards. He is a member of a Boston men's social and book-oriented club. He is always up for birding, including revisiting some of his haunts in the Everglades. He resolves to resume tennis and to add more sculling to his weekly trail walking. He looks for conversation on topics and ideas, such as through HILR, as one means toward an enriched retirement.

The nine grandchildren range from eleven years to one month. Joanne and Chuck see a lot of them at home and in the summer on Squam Lake in New Hampshire.

For the previous 20 years, she built her own organizational consulting and executive coaching firm, focused on creating great places to work, culture change, enhancing performance, and fostering learning and growth. She sees learning as an active, engaging, and creative process and is delighted to have found kindred spirits at HILR. Ellen learned her craft over ten years at Digital Equipment Corporation where, after alternating among HR management, organizational development, and talent management roles, she led the transformation of the 3300-person HR organization worldwide. She was a member of multiple networks of colleagues and an active board member, committee chair, conference co-chair, and President of two different professional organizations in her field. Ellen's work life began on an Israeli kibbutz in '71-72. On return to the US, she taught high school, where she had her class on China do manual labor and earn one collective grade so they could ""experience"" the world through Chinese eyes. She led an alternative away-from-home internship program and enrolled as a student at the school where she'd taught, wrote up her experiences, and wound up on the national news media, including Time Magazine and TheToday Show. After teaching, she developed a diversity program for urban and suburban students in the arts and media, using the city as her classroom. Her work in education culminated in a stint at the MA Governor's Office of Educational Affairs, focused on educational reform and professional development for teachers. A native New Yorker, she brings energy, enthusiasm, and a spirit of adventure to her endeavors. She is an avid explorer, having traveled to all continents except Antarctica. In ice cream shops, while others choose vanilla or chocolate, Ellen can't believe they don't carry Ginger-Fig Rhumba. Additionally, Ellen loves film, the arts, and design.

She was later promoted to Senior Administrative Manager at IBM!s corporate headquarters. After taking early retirement from IBM, Renee became the Executive Director of The Addison Disease Foundation.

She has made at least fifteen trips to Zambia, using this as her home base for more extensive travels to Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and other Africa nations. These trips to Africa were not at four star hotels. Renee was deeply involved in relief work, distributing food, mosquito netting, toys and books to orphanages and village inhabitants.

After college at Mt Holyoke, she went to medical school ""abroad"" at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and then did pediatric Residency back at Boston Children's, thanks to her incredibly good fortune of being included in the first group of The Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, as it was then called. The Institute was the idea of Mary Bunting, then President of Radcliffe, for PhD or equivalent women who could not get into the academic workforce because they had families and were considered ""undependable"" . For Nancy, the Institute paved the way for her to be the first woman with children allowed a Residency at Children's. It seems ridiculous now! After 30 year in private practice of Pediatrics in Concord and environs, Nancy felt the need to move on, as HMOs were taking over Massachusetts, and paper work was not what she thought practicing medicine should be. Ultimately she ended up in Cambodia, where medicine, and education, for orphaned or disadvantaged children in the countryside was basically nonexistent. Fifteen years ago she started The Sharing Foundation, which now serves over 1500 kids a day in an orphanage and multiple schools. Nancy has just retired, but the Foundation goes on strongly, and she plans to go to Cambodia yearly, indefinitely.

After (finally!) obtaining his PhD he joined the newly-created NASA Electronics Center near Kendall Square, only to have it closed a few years later in 1970. Fortunately, he was among those staff members asked to stay on when that facility was transferred to the recently-formed US Department of Transportation and eventually named Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. That began 35 very interesting and educational years of research and analysis directed toward identifying promising technological advances relevant to transportation and fostering their application. At various times John was classified as a physicist, general engineer, computer specialist, and (for his last 15 years), transportation technology policy analyst in a strategic planning group. During his time at the Volpe Center he was involved in various ways with almost every mode of transportation, potential innovations from many viewpoints: suitability and practicality of technologies, economic realities, safety and environmental implications, political considerations, real-world viability, and the perspective of passengers, shippers, equipment providers, system operators and other stakeholders. His childhood interest in astronomy resurfaced about 20 years ago, and advancing his understanding of the cosmos has become an important part of his life. For 13 years one spur to this activity has been volunteering at the Cambridge high school to help students participating in the astronomy (really astrophysics) event in the Massachusetts Science Olympiad. He also visits a local fifth grade science classroom monthly, and for more than 10 years has been a volunteer at Boston's Museum of Science, primarily interacting with visitors to discuss astronomy and space topics.

She is from the tiny bedroom her mother papered with maps from around the world. A large map of Africa, its borders like the silhouette of a man with his head thrown back, crying out with hunger or rage, held watch over the foot of her bed until she was five, and that silhouette took root in her consciousness, something about how the places we are born in shape the directions our lives take. She is from another concrete block house, sunk into the rich soil of Southern Ontario, where her parents listened to the black plastic Zenith radio perched on the fresh earth that surrounded the fallout shelter they dug into their backyard while they listened to news of Kennedy and Khrushchev and talked about the possibility of an atom bomb dropping 60 miles away, just over the border in that rich and powerful country to the south, in the city of Detroit, an industrial capital of the world at the time, a rather scary metropolis that created long sleek cars and its own brand of dance music blasted over the radio. That fallout shelter took root in her consciousness, something about where we each fit in the passage of history and how that shapes us. Maggie is also from a time when female virginity was prized and pregnancy outside of marriage was stigmatized; she left high school at 17, married, and learned how to be a skillful housewife, who knew how to economize by stewing elbow macaroni with ground beef and tomatoes, and how to keep house to her mother-in-law's standards by polishing the tile floors until they gleamed every week. That experience is a deep taproot in her consciousness; something about how the societies we function in shape our lives and who we become. We fit in naturally or learn to conform to the time and places and societies we inhabit, and as we age we become like one of those gnarled bonsai trees that has taken root on a coastline with prevailing or shifting winds, even those of us who have lived as migratory birds (of no fixed migratory pattern) settle down at some point.

The latter was based in New York, but John worked primarily out of Boston ___ where he sometimes felt that to survive his consulting career, his primary office was in an airplane. John joined APM when it had twenty-four employees, and the firm grew to over 200 consultants and developed relationships with hospitals throughout the fifty states as well as Canada and England.

Clients were as varied as the University of Chicago's four hospitals, to hospital mergers in rural Ohio, to four years, almost weekly, at Touro Infirmary in New Orleans. When APM was sold, he joined a local healthcare consulting firm, Cambridge Management Group for three years prior to joining Performance Logic, Inc., founded with his ""Operations Improvement"" partner at APM, Inc. and three other consultants. This firm's goal was to do ""Operations Improvement"" at hospitals without on-site supervision by giving hospital staff benchmarks, and guidelines for task forces, job descriptions and implementation of cost-saving and quality improvement programs.

,Richard,,Johnson,,,,,"986 Memorial Drive, Apt 304  Cambridge, MA 02138",617 529 3978,richjn@gmail.com,,,,,,,"Richard Johnson grew up in Jacksonville, Florida and south Georgia; so he was 11 when he saw his first mountain and loved it. He served in the US Air Force as a radar mechanic in Mississippi (flat), South Dakota (the flat part), and South Carolina (flat). Richard earned a BSEE from the University of Florida (flat), graduating in 1972. While at UF he worked on The Alligator, the daily student newspaper, and helped organize Vets for Peace. Richard's first job after graduation was with Trayer Engineering, a San Francisco (hills!) electrical manufacturer. There he finished the development and started the production of a vacuum switch when that technology was being introduced in utility systems. He returned to the Southeast and worked for Gold Kist, an agricultural cooperative in Atlanta, where he was the only member of the engineering staff with any farm experience. There he designed electrical systems for poultry processing plants, feed mills and other agricultural facilities. He designed the electrical and control systems for the country's first triple___fired (peanut hulls, wood chips, oil), alternative fuel boiler. By sly use of construction documents, he introduced computer control to agricultural processing plants. After leaving Gold Kist, Richard worked as an electrical design engineer for CH2M HILL and Metcalf and Eddy over several decades. At those firms he specialized in design of water and wastewater plants. He introduced computer control and advanced drives to industries that insisted on more traditional approaches. Richard finished his career as the Chief Electrical and Instrumentation and Control Engineer for AECOM. All the firms he worked for are still in business, though several of them have changed their name in hopes he won't be able to locate them. He is currently retired, providing occasional engineering support to projects. Growing up in Florida gave Richard the outlook that history was malleable, where commerce was concerned, and distant. South Dakota showed him that history could be observed (the wagon ruts were still there) and fixed. While living there he developed an interest in the history of the area and of the early 19th century fur trade, an interest he has continued to pursue. So Boston is a pleasure since history is preserved, accessible and rarely revised without proof. Living in Atlanta for 20 years showed Richard what unrestrained development could do to an area. It also showed him how many small theatres would develop where there was a concentration of people. Both of these have caused him to appreciate the pleasures of the Boston area. Richard has been in the Boston area for a dozen years, first on Beacon Hill, now in Cambridge. He lives with Lucretia Slaughter, another member of HILR. Richard has an amazing daughter living in Boise, an IT director. Richard is interested in reading, local sights, and computer applications. Having learned FORTRAN, PL1, Pascal and Prolog, among others, Richard is convinced his interest in any code is the kiss of death. He therefore confidently predicts the demise of Ruby on Rails.

,Herbert,,Kagan,,,,,  ,,hmkag@verizon.net,,,,,,,"I was born and grew up in Boston. Indeed my birth year coincided with the first election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the Presidency, which, coupled with the 13 years of his tenure in that public office, accounts for my continuing affinities for the public policies which he espoused. My education included a 6 year curriculum in languages and classics at Boston Latin School and continued with the award of B.S. and M.S degrees in Microbiology at the University of Massachusetts. This was immediately followed by an unsolicited offer of a two year Instructorship from the Microbiology Department at Purdue University which I was happy to accept and which presented the opportunity for my first teaching experience. Although the broad A's and misplaced R's of my Boston accent were initially puzzling to my midwestern students, these were gradually overcome to the degree that my students fully recognized that I was, in fact , lecturing in English. The tug of my Boston roots proved sufficiently strong for me to return to the Athens of America initially pursuing a mixture of basic and applied research at Arthur D. Little, Inc. My interests soon refocussed on the discipline of Bioochemistry, thus leading me to pursue a Ph.D. in that subject at Tufts Medical School. That experience remains a highlight of my career and alerted me to the subdisciplines of enzymology and protein chemistry which were the bases of much of my subsequent research career. Following a three year postdoctoral research fellowship at Harvard Medical School, I joined the Department of Biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine in 1969 where I taught graduate and medical students and carried out a nearly 40 year, NIH-funded research program on the catalytic mechanisms, biosynthetic pathways and genetic regulation of key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis, metabolic degradation and repair of the collagen and elastin components of the extracellular matrix. I partially retired in 2008 retaining a 10% Professorship and fully retired as Professor Emeritus as of August, 2011. My non-professional activities include my largely self-taught efforts at playing the piano, capturing the pictorial essence of landscapes and still-life settings by oil painting, maneuvering Soling sail boats among the islands of Boston Harbor, and 150+ hours of instructional and solo flights in Cessna 172 aircraft. My long held fascination with photography has blossomed since my retirement and, although Alfred Steiglitz has nothing to fear for his well earned reputation as a masterful photographer, I continue to greatly enjoy that now-digital process. My wife, Elly, and I have been fortunate enough to have traveled to several national and international conferences to which I have been invited as a speaker as well as travel purely for the experience. Our destinations have included many trips to Italy and other European countries, Kenya, Budapest, China, Argentina and, perhaps most memorably, our crossing of the South Atlantic for our visit to the Antarctic Penninsula. Thousands of Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins as well as whales, seals and a variety of avian creatures were among our animal hosts as we explored the coastal regions of that remarkable continent.",,,Art|Biological Science|Computer science|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|History|Italian|Literature|Medicine|Music|Physical Science|Travel

They lived in Dorchester in a neighborhood where there was little opportunity for after school play. What does a lonely kid do? Practice the piano a lot and read all the fairy tales in the Codman Square Library, more than once. It was not until she went to Girls' Latin School in downtown Boston that she made friends. Within a year after graduation from Smith she married Sy Kaufman, a Boston radiologist (d.1984), and started a family. After 12 years as a stay-at-home Mom she went back to school and earned a Master of Music degree from Boston University School of Fine Arts. Her first job was on the Preparatory School faculty of the New England Conservatory. She is still affiliated with NEC in the Continuing Education Department and does limited teaching of piano and harpsichord. Her musical life is made up of many chapters. In graduate school she became part of a duo-piano team. The most memorable of their concerts was performing the Piston Concerto for Two Pianos with the Boston Pops while Walter Piston was still here to coach them. But after commencement her duo-piano partner moved to Europe and Charlotte refocused her attention on the harpsichord which became a lifelong passion, though her stated major was in piano performance. Private post-graduate study on the harpsichord led to the founding of The Friends of Dr. Burney, a vocal and instrumental ensemble, which performed 18th--century ballad operas (she calls them the Saturday Night Live of the 18th-century) annually on the Museum of Fine Arts' Early Music Series from 1981 to 1987. These were largely unpublished works which Charlotte reconstructed from original sources. FDB also performed at the Library of Congress, The Folger Shakespeare Library and the Mellon Center of British Art. Charlotte's current musical chapter began 16 years ago when she renamed the ensemble, Boston Musical Theater. Having become a 501 (c) 3 corporation, BMT is still a vocal and instrumental ensemble performing popular music but has moved up into 20th-century repertoire. BMT offers two performances of American music a year. In 1994 Charlotte wrote the introductory preface to a Garland Press facsimile edition of a Boston operetta, The Doctor of Alcantara by Julius Eichberg, and in 1998, A-R Editions published her critical performing edition (complete with instrumental parts) of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's comic opera, Le Devin du village. Boston Musical Theater has published four CDs of American popular music in the last decade. Charlotte has a wonderful family, three children and seven grandchildren. None live in Boston but they remain close and are an endless source of pride and pleasure.

,Patricia,,Ketchum,,,,,  ,,psketchum@gmail.com,,,,,,,"Born in Manhattan, Patricia grew up in various locations along the East Coast. She majored in English at Bryn Mawr College, then worked for The Washington Post, first as a ""copyboy"" and later as a reporter. After marrying a documentary film producer, she turned to daytime writing at newsletters, the US Forest Service, and to creating narrations for her husband's films. The arrival of the first of her two sons, brought about a second career change: to full-time mothering, household management, and school-related volunteer activities. At age 40, she entered law school at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA, graduating in !980. She practiced in the field of bankruptcy law for several years in Washington, DC, before stumbling on her dream career. To Patricia's surprise, on her first day of law school, she had fallen in love with the subject of court rules and procedures. When she learned that the Administrative Office of the US Courts offered the possibility to work extensively with the committees that draft the rules of practice for all federal courts, she knew that was where she wanted to be. During more than 20 years of federal service that followed, Patricia provided legal and drafting support to the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, traveled throughout the country evaluating judicial workloads in the bankruptcy courts, and participated in the design and development of electronic record-keeping and electronic filing of documents throughout the federal courts. She continues to work with the federal courts' rules committees as a consultant. By the time she was seven Patricia had discovered she loved cooking, an activity which continues to provide her with joy, relaxation, new experiences, and frequent challenges. Chinese, French, Italian, and New American cuisines are particular favorites, and led to her developing and teaching two Chinese cooking courses in Virginia during her homebound years. After retiring, she lived in Paris for nine months and studied at the Le Cordon Bleu cooking school. She received her Diplome de Cuisine from Le Cordon Bleu in 2008. During the many years she lived in Washington, DC, Patricia regularly conducted eye screening tests of elementary and middle school students in the DC public and charter schools as a member and president of a downtown Lions Club. She is married to Robert Ketchum, a graduate of the Harvard Divinity School. As a newcomer to the Boston area, Patricia looks forward both to learning and to the opportunities for fellowship at HILR.",,,Business|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Economics|Film|French|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|History|Italian|Literature|Technology|Travel|Writing

My stay was again extended when I signed on as a very junior scientist in the R&D laboratory of Corning Inc. Here I remained until I volunteered for an army program that took me through basic training and then on to OCS at the antiaircraft and guided missile center at Fort Bliss, Texas, where I was to be through the end of the Korean Conflict. My army service was followed by travel in Europe, capped by a year at the Sorbonne in a program of general studies. I came back to earn an MBA at the Wharton School which led to a corporate planning assignment with Union Carbide in New York City. This was followed by a more down to earth stint with an MIT startup on route 128 called High Voltage Engineering. Here I was Eastern Regional Sales Manager for their line of particle accelerators. In my early thirties, with a wife and two small children, I left to take a degree at the Harvard Divinity School. After a number of student parish experiences, I decided my calling was more properly in the academy than the church. Invited by the president of Syracuse to be his assistant, I spent four years learning the art of university administration and completing the requirements for a PhD which combined studies in philosophy, history, and religion. These credentials landed me a job at Northeastern as director of the graduate school and associate dean of the college of arts and sciences. I became interim dean for a year and then moved to the college of business where my teaching focus was a required course called the Social Responsibilities of Business. On retirement I launched a new career with my wife as a teacher of English as a second language (ESL). We taught in universities and language schools in Virginia, California, Hawaii, and later in Strasbourg and Brittany, as part of an exchange arrangement with the University of California at Berkeley.

I relish the opportunity to read and discuss ideas with others; thus, hearing different perspectives and gaining a deeper understanding of a variety of topics. There are many areas of interest that I have. As an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, I majored in history and concentrated on the unification movements of Germany and Italy. A range of questions, the ""why"" of historical events, aroused a change of academic focus and the pursuit of graduate work in psychology. I received my Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Chicago after which I taught as a Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics. Twenty-five years ago after my husband was courted to teach at Harvard, we and our three children, moved to Boston. I became the Director of Counseling at Concord Academy and began a small private practice. Following that, I worked at BBN in the Lower School as the consulting psychologist. I have been fortunate to have travelled widely as an accompanying person because of my husband's research of global viral infections. As we been to numerous and varied countries for instance Rawanda, Italy, and China; my people watcher behavior, a natural bent, has thrived.

,Rick,,Lamb,,,,,"21 Grant Street  Cambridge, MA. 02138",617-868-1939,arlamb1943@mac.com,,,,,,,"Albert Richard (Rick) Lamb III, FAAR My career as a Landscape Architect has been fortunate to have been influenced by important personalities and mentors along its path. As a boy of 4 or 5, my material grandmother introduced me to the form and secrets of her garden. A Vassar friend of my mother, starting a new program called the Student Conservation Program, encouraged me as a teenager to spend a summer in the Olympic National Park, absorbing a new landscape with its intricate rhymes and scales. During the summers of my 4th and 5th Form years at school, Walter Dorwin Teague offered me a very junior position at their NYC industrial design firm. Under the tutelage of their senior designers I was introduced to the wide range of design and product manufacturing including ski boots, cars, implements of various kinds, food packaging and the interiors of passenger airplanes. An uncle in education persuaded me to apply to the Rhode Island School of Design, which in turn coached me in formal landscape architectural training. My last year was spent on their European Honors Program in Rome, Italy. There, in addition to travel and under the tutelage of architect Fredrick ST. FLORIAN,I prepared a thesis on the Landscape Architect in theFuture City, attempting to define the role of the landscape architect, employing design principles of the past to the needs and design tends of the future. Summers were spent at the New York firm, Clarke and Rapunao, landscape architects and engineers. Mr. Rapuano was evolving several significant projects for Robert Moses, presenting me with the opportunity to work in both rural and urban environments from Seattle to the New York area. After RISD, I chose The University of Michigan over Harvard for graduate work in Landscape Architecture. In Ann Arbor, I had the opportunity to study with Professors Bill and Carl Johnson. The program further honed my design skills learned at RISD, Clarke and Rapuano and Walter Dorwin Teague. Following Michigan, I was fortunate to win the Rome Prize in Landscape Architecture. My fellowship at the American Academy in Rome was extended for a second year allowing for further extensive travel throughout portions of North Africa, Europe, and Scandinavia studying gardens, architecture and pedestrian spaces and activities formed within differing cultures. The Academy afforded time to develop personal thoughts, sketches and ideas. While at the American Academy, the opportunity to consult with The Architects Collaborative, working with partner Louis MacMillan, on projects in Tunisia and Kuwait expanded my landscape design experience into Middle East culture, techniques and plant material. Working with the Landscape Architect Dan Kiley followed the Academy. Dan Kiley was an extraordinary designer who layered historical references with local character and client personality. Appealingly simple but incredibly complex sensitive designs were evidenced in the landscapes of the private residences to the challenge of a corporation roof scape and interior court. After becoming involved in several US projects, Mr. Kiley asked me to represent him in his Paris office overseeing the surface plaza design, and implementation on the La Defense project at the west end of the Louvre axis through Paris. Two years ""working"" , under the direction from the Vermont office, with energized French engineers and architects and visiting artists including Alexander Calder while under the direction from the Vermont office was indeed an incredible experience. After Paris and Rome, I realized that as a landscape architect I had to choose a life as an expatriate or return to the United States. The move was to the small village of Barnstable on Cape Cod to join a practice of a RISD colleague. Unfortunately the office was a victim the economic downturn of the early seventies. Fortunately Barnstable was the summer residence of Cambridge architect Ben Thompson, and the beginning of a five-year working relationship. At first, my services focused on the landscape design of a series of Middle East hotels, drawing from my TAC experiences and a confortable understanding of varied cultures. Next as a member of BTA's dynamic interdisciplinary team, the Faneuil Hall, Baltimore and South Street Seaport Marketplaces were created. Ben Thompson set me outside his office to receive his ""spirit"" cards and directives to translate them into a new city with an luminous landmark for 50,000 residents for the new state capital city in Willow, Alaska or a flowing stairway to feature beautiful people at an opera house to be in St., Paul. Ben demonstrated to me how he felt a project's spirit before endeavoring to design its shape. Ben Thompson was a storyteller who created architecture in a vibrantly interactive office on Story Street. Toward the end of my tenure at BTA, I was offered a position to teach the second year design studio at Harvard's Graduate School of Design and subsequently join the Boston office if The SWA Group working with its founder Peter Walker. My career at SWA allowed for my continued teaching and membership on the Recreation Council of the Urban League Institute. After serving on several development and community evaluation panels and charrettes, I had gathered a rich network of speakers for a class I was now leading at MIT's Center for Real Estate (Development). My in office projects included master planning Long Boat Key in Sarasota, Florida; housing projects for New Seabury on Cape Cod; a zoo master plan and implementation the Millbrook School in Millbrook, New York and finally a master plan/envisioning of a new golf and seaside resort for some 25,000 guests and residents on Gran Canaria Island in the Canary Islands. 1990 presented and opportunity to leave the SWA Group, now a thriving international landscape architectural and land planning firm with more than 250 practitioners located in more than 8 offices, based in Sausalito, California, for a more individual practice focused on estate design with varied and challenging site design and focusing on the program of a single client/client couple. Each project would become a unique design, engaging master craftsmen and gardeners crafting special materials. A fishing camp on several hundred acres in the intermountains of Colorado contrasted with a seaside estate. A story was created for most projects from which the landscape and architecture was scripted. Together with predominately projects in Massachusetts, design opportunities were accepted in California, Colorado, Michigan, Maine, North Carolina and New Jersey. To the present, special landscape designs continue to create design challenges. More time has been allocated toward volunteering with Historic New England in the site evaluation of some of their many properties. I was recently asked to join the Board at Gore Place in Waltham and lead a task force to update the master plan for the 50-acre property. Expanding Governor Gore's story for the land, developing initiatives to implement the overall plan and defining its audience into the future has become a rewarding challenge, drawing from my past experiences. My wife Nancy, also a landscape architect, is extremely active overseeing the important costume collection of the Colonial Dames, located in their headquarters on Beacon Hill. We, together with our dogs, spend our time between our Cambridge and Barnstable residences enjoying gardening, friends, drawing, boating and more recently wood turning not to mention a good book or two. A new career chapter looks forward to involvement with the HILR, both participating in classes and hopefully sharing a varied and fun design career, continuing my love of teaching and story telling.",,,Art|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Climate Change & Ecology|Computer science|Economics|French|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|History|Italian|Literature|Physical Science|Social Science|Sports|Technology|Travel

In the same neighborhood were the Carnegie Library and Museum, the Symphony, Forbes Field for baseball (the Pirates), and a large park with a small golf course. What more could a curious kid want? Rick escaped all that culture by being sent off to boarding school. He went from there to Princeton, ending up in statistics rather than pure mathematics, continuing through AB, MA, and ABD (all but dissertation for the PhD), with side trips from sadistics into philosophy and computing. He fell into the computer software business during a small hiatus from college. That paid part of college expenses -- programming was a rare skill back in the Sixties, and tuition was lower -- and then provided a good career. He worked at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Compaq in New England for twenty-five years in a variety of engineering roles building software systems, then went to Dell in Austin, Texas. He was at Dell for eleven years, retiring recently from the Office of the CTO where he was architect for system management web services. While serving his sentence in Austin, Rick wrote the Tales of Texas about how that culture seemed foreign to a new transplant. He's now working on a similar series, called A Land Without Rs, about how Cambridge feels after a dozen years away. It may also be enlightening to the Texans. Both series (linked here) appear on www.ricksoft.com, and are still being expanded. Another odd thing for your amusement: Financial Meltdown: 2008 Was a Subprime Year, a quick summary of the many things that went wrong leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. And, sadly, most of them are still with us. Rick tries to keep his computer skills sharp. He is currently working on two projects. He spends most of his time writing simulation programs for MIT Informatics, developing strategies for preserving libraries of digital documents over long periods of time. (The current answer, btw, is to make a number of copies, store them in other locations, and check regularly to see that the people you gave them to still have them.) He also works with Dick Rubinstein on the technology needed by the HILR Curriculum Committee, the nice people who plan and schedule our courses. And he's looking for other interesting projects, maybe in artificial life or computational biology. If there were any time left for reading, he would try to catch up on years of neglected books, too. Rick and Beverly Thornton, wife of many decades, just moved back to Cambridge from Austin. We came for the weather, but were misinformed.

Berkeley's School of Social Welfare where she received her M.S.W. Following this, she worked for several years as a Juvenile Probation Officer, placing neglected and abused children in foster homes and institutions. This was the most difficult job she ever had and provided a solid, if not unusual, foundation for ensuing careers. A desire to work with children under more positive conditions led her to join the education staff of The Exploratorium in San Francisco where she developed and taught science programs for school children and developed a volunteer school outreach program. After leaving the Exploratorium, she completed a teacher certification program for elementary and secondary school, shortly after which she returned to Boston to join the Education Department of the Museum of Science. While at the Science Museum, Susan taught classroom programs on a variety of topics and gave public demonstrations that required her to learn about snakes, porcupines, skunks, ferrets, and iguanas, to name a few animals, and how to handle them. Additionally, she managed the Museum's school outreach program funded by the Massachusetts Department of Education following desegregation of the Boston schools. During this time, she built collaborative projects not only with the schools, but also with other cultural as well as educational institutions in Boston. Her management experience at the Science Museum fueled an interest in working in the for-profit world and eventually led to a new business (sales) position in the Investment Management and Trust division of the First National Bank of Boston. Soon after her arrival at the First, she studied for and acquired the Certified Financial Planner (C.F.P.) designation. Despite the innumerable changes in the name of the bank and the constant changes in strategy, Susan remained in her sales position for 18 years. After Fleet acquired BankBoston, Susan left to become Director of Fiduciary Services at the law firm of Foley Hoag where she remained for five years. Here she was instrumental in revamping the Department while also providing services to clients, acting as a liaison to Trustees and serving as a Trustee. She continues to apply the skills and knowledge gained from more than 25 years in the financial services industry in a small private practice in which she acts as a personal CFO to individuals. After putting her beloved 14 year-old greyhound to sleep, Susan spent a year preparing for the sale of her Concord home and move to smaller quarters closer to the city. Serendipitously, she wound up renting in University Park at MIT and has decided to remain there for the foreseeable future, since this arrangement affords easy access to friends, HILR, cultural activities and the airport for the many trips anticipated in the coming years.

At Radcliffe, I majored in Biochemical Sciences because of a wonderful experimental course on genetics I had in high school. I gravitated toward neuroscience and then cognitive development as I realized I was more interested in the programs behind our thinking than in the hardware through which it is done. At Radcliffe, I met my husband, Doug (also a member of HILR), who was a year ahead of me at Harvard. We were married right after I finished college and we moved to New York City together for graduate school. I received my PhD from Columbia University in Experimental Psychology and landed my first job teaching Developmental and Cognitive Psychology at New York University. NYU promoted me to Associate Professor, but did not grant me tenure. Meanwhile, Doug received his law degree from Columbia Law School, worked at a Wall Street firm, and then served as an Assistant US Attorney in the Eastern District of New York. We moved back to the Boston Area, and I was hired by the Wellesley College Psychology Department as an Adjunct Associate Professor. I continued to teach there part-time for twenty years, while also conducting longitudinal studies of epistemological development from preschool through middle school and over the college years. I then joined Wellesley's Office of Institutional Research full-time as a research analyst. I worked in OIR for the next fifteen years until my retirement. When I first moved from teaching with research on the side to solely research, I missed teaching, but that faded. I loved having a job in which I interacted with people at all levels across the college and in which I could find and follow patterns in data that might enable the College to improve. Our two sons are now in their 30's and married. Greg is a lawyer with The Hartford insurance company and Rick is an Assistant Professor of Economics at Cornell University.

He attended Phillips Academy in Andover and Harvard College, graduating in 1968. In 1969, Doug married Annick Faflick Mansfield, a Lexington native who graduated from Harvard that year. After teaching middle school American history and performing military service, he attended Columbia Law School, obtaining his J.D. degree in 1973, while Annick obtained a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia that same year. Doug began his legal career in New York in 1973 with the firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle. He worked with outstanding trial lawyers Peter Fleming and John Sprizzo in the well-publicized defenses of former Attorney General John Mitchell and Arthur Anderson & Co. in the Robert Vesco and Four Seasons Nursing Homes prosecutions. His work was divided between civil business litigation, particularly securities and antitrust, and white collar criminal defense. In 1977 Doug was appointed an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and he gained valuable trial experience prosecuting a wide range of federal crimes, including a conspiracy to import heroin from Thailand. In 1980 Doug and Annick and their young son moved back to the Boston area, and Doug joined the firm now known as Casner & Edwards, LLP, becoming a partner in 1982. From 1980 to 2014 Doug practiced as a litigator, splitting his time between civil business cases and white collar criminal defense. The white collar cases included potential charges of tax fraud, defense contractor fraud, environmental crimes, and antitrust crimes. The business litigation cases included defense of professionals and fiduciaries, defense of securities and antitrust claims, and litigation of claims of breach of contract or business tort involving businesses or nonprofits. Since 1980 Annick has worked at Wellesley College, first as a psychology professor and then as a researcher/director of Wellesley's Office of Internal Research.

This experience of living in a different country and seeing it change dramatically has influenced me greatly. In 1962 I enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, and was surprised to see how quickly I fit in. The idealism of the students I met and their interest in other cultures made me feel very much at home. Since then, I have spent many years teaching English composition and a Survey of Literary Forms as an adjunct instructor at the junior college and college levels.

,Anita,,Marshall,,,,,"102 Summer St.  Andover, MA 01810",978-475-5921,anmameade@aol.com,,,,,,,"Anita was born in Antigua and raised in Dominica, a small island in the Caribbean. She moved to New York after high school with the dream of attending college. She had little knowledge of American universities and even less knowledge of the application process. By chance she came across a newspaper article about Julie Nixon attending Smith College. Anita figured that Smith College must be a good school since the president had chosen it for his daughter. Armed with confidence and a great deal of na__vet__, Anita applied to Smith College and was miraculously accepted with a full scholarship. After graduating from college Anita entered a training program as a systems analyst. Over the next fifteen years she held a number of positions in various high tech companies. During that time she got married and had two children. Anita had little interest in the business world but needed the income those jobs provided as she was often the sole financial supporter of her family. Some years later she entered therapy to help figure out her options and in that first session she knew she wanted to train to become a therapist. Two weeks before the start of the new school year, Anita somehow managed to convince the admissions committee at Simmons College to accept her into the MSW program. Upon graduation in 1991 Anita began her new career at an outpatient clinic in Boston. There, she worked with young children and adolescents. She enjoyed that job immensely and with great supervision and many additional courses and seminars, Anita honed her skills as a clinician. In 1995 she accepted a job with the service arm of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. There, she worked with children whose parental rights had been terminated but who had little chance of being adopted. This job proved to be the most gratifying of her career as she tirelessly advocated for these youths. Many of these children went on to college and have since created productive and meaningful lives for themselves. Sadly, Anita lost her oldest child twelve years ago. The death of that child was her impetus to retire at the first opportunity and to live a life doing everything she had always hoped to do. She retired three years ago. A learning program such as HILR is a dream come true as it allows the opportunity to take new courses she was too scared to take while in college. Anita enjoys traveling and has escaped to Dominica the past two winters.",,,Business|Computer science|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|Travel

By 1949 I had finished high school and adapted to the communist system. This was not particularly difficult, since it was a welcome change from fascism. During his freshman year at Technical University of Budapest I did well and earned a scholarship to study in Poland. I arrived in Poland as a sophomore knowing three Polish words. A Polish-Hungarian dictionary did not exist. The translation was done via German. I earned a BS and MA in Chemical Engineering. Just prior to the 1956 Hungarian revolution, I was married in Poland. We planned to move to Budapest, so I was there looking for an apartment. After the revolution erupted,my wife,Urszula was stranded in Poland,She finally managed to join me. But by this time all borders were closed, so we stayed in Budapest. Although totally disillusioned with the system, we remained there 10 years. Our next opportunity came taking a risky ""vacation"" to Italy. Telling no one, we left Budapest, leaving possessions behind. Nine months after arriving in Rome, we obtained papers needed to immigrate to the U.S. We arrived in New York in April, 1967. Soon afterward, I was employed by International Paper initially as research engineer, where I spent my career. In 2003 I retired as European director of sales and marketing.

On my fourth birthday, after my father secured a new job back in his home state of Massachusetts, my family moved to Framingham, where no doubt the parents of many of my playmates were already participating in a famous longitudinal heart study that would later shape many of my decisions as a primary care doctor_though not for two and a half decades, and only after my life had started to unfold in other directions. I lived for four and a half years in England starting in 1959, after my father's company offered him a prolonged position in London. I remember walking through the streets of London and seeing, everywhere,_it seems like it was every couple of blocks, but perhaps it was only every three_building after building in rubble. To others, these were the grim reminders of how the Battle of Britain had changed history, and also vague hints of how long was the reach, fourteen years after all the fighting was over, of the aftermath of war, even in a first world country with huge resources for self-repair. But for this eleven-year-old, these reminders and hints were lost. Before I knew it, I was a sophomore at Brown, wanting to meet Loren Dribinsky, whom I did finally meet as a junior, and whom I would marry three years after that. Oh, and I also earned my degree in English and American Literature, which I planned later to teach. First, however, I served two years of alternative service as a conscientious objector, then took one very successful semester of graduate English at the University of Michigan. Loren was by then a third year medical student, and it was in those months, after long and unexpected thought, that I decided I too would be a physician. This was not an easy process, without any pre-med courses under my belt, but four and a half years later I graduated from SUNY at Stony Brook School of Medicine. By 1980 I was practicing primary care in Burlington, Massachusetts, where I worked for more than twenty-nine years until retirement last year. Loren and I have a son and a daughter, and I have enjoyed the odd mixture of pain, but mostly pleasure, watching them grow up. I even learned violin to help out while my kids were learning Suzuki violin and cello, well enough for me to join an auditionless orchestra. Now my son lives in Somerville with his wife and our granddaughter, while our daughter will move with her husband and our grandson-to-be to Medford this spring_sometimes life can be very kind. I took up running while in medical school, ran a sub-2:50 marathon in my thirties, and a sub-5:00 mile in my forties. I still train regularly and race often. I have traveled in and out of the U.S. where my wife and I have taken long hikes through beautiful and often historic landscapes. In retirement, I have been reading extensively about genetics, evolution, primate evolution, human evolution, climate change, language, theories of the origins of language, and how all these things may or may not fit together. I am now looking forward to many years of reciprocal personal enrichment at HILR, and, among many other things, I am hoping that some of the members there will help me sort some of this particular stuff out!

,Murray,,Melbin,,,,,"36 Highland Ave  Cambridge, 02139",617-354-2421,acegik@bu.edu,,,,,,,"I was born and raised in Bronx, New York. After military service the GI Bill helped me return to school, at City College then NYU. Then, completing a Cornell M.S. I gave a year to adventure, hitch-hiking and walking through Africa for fourteen months. It turned my interest from business to social science. At the University of Michigan I earned an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Psychology and Sociology. Just as important, the African journey fortified a wanderlust that led me worldwide. In reunions friends and relatives often ask ""So where are you going this year?"" Among those jaunts I worked as a volunteer in a Peruvian children's home and in a Hungarian high school. Meanwhile a post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard led to five years as lecturer there, followed by another five as research associate in its medical school. I studied hospital ward staffing, which in turn led me to wonder (in early 1970s) about society's increase in around-the-clock activity. The research essay (""Night As Frontier"" ) telling how and why was awarded the annual behavioral science prize by AAAS. Transferring to Boston University I served as Professor of Sociology, till retirement. I like classical music. Am politically liberal. Am writing a book about charity (not an exhortation but an account). I read steadily, especially on art and on natural science, while drinking tea or coffee from a mug emblazoned ""So many books, so little time."" Of two other main themes, the minor one began by building a box and finding one side inevitably shorter than the others even after ostensibly cutting to even up. (A friend called it ""inchitis,"" a deficiency disease.) It led to reading books, much trial and error, and finally enough ability in carpentry, cabinet work and electrical wiring to enable me to do most renovations in my dwellings. The main thread was marriage and the births of two daughters. Their mother died twelve years ago and they, now grown and married, have a strong loving relationship with me. Of all the joys and excitement I was lucky to experience, the peak has been parenthood.

,Marilyn,,Mellowes,,,,,"190 Lexington Ave.  Cambridge, MA. 02138",617-354-3930,j2c68@comcast.net,,,,,,,"Marilyn Mellowes is a producer and writer of documentary films who worked at WGBH/Boston for nearly thirty-five years. Her credits include major landmark series and documentary programs broadcast nationally on public television to both popular and critical acclaim. She is best known for the four-hour series From Jesus to Christ: the First Christians, which used in-depth interviews with twelve leading New Testament scholars and archaeologists to explore the origins of Christianity as it grew from a small Jewish sect to a major religion embraced by the Roman world. When it premiered in April 1998, The New York Times called the series ""admirably produced"" and proclaimed ""This work is a revelation of what television can be."" The series has been rebroadcast many times in the United States and widely distributed overseas. Mellowes began her career as a writer and producer of new programing at WGBH in 1976. The station was then embarking upon an ambitious thirteen-hour co-production with British and French television on the controversial subject of the Vietnam War. Mellowes worked on three of the thirteen programs, including the widely praised ""LBJ Goes to War"" that examined how Lyndon Johnson embroiled America in the conflict. VIETNAM: A Television Historyset the standard for excellence in historical programming on television, won every major award in broadcasting, and established WGBH as a preeminent national production center. After VIETNAM, the series FRONTLINE asked Mellowes to produce ""Castro's Challenge, one of four films in the special series Crisis in Central America. In the mid-80s, Mellowes was assigned a daunting task: to develop a new, major series on American history under the direction of WGBH's vice-president of national programming. That series, the American Experience, was launched in 1986 and became the leading strand of programing broadcast nationally on PBS. Mellowes served as the first Series Editor, working with producers and executives to select stories and create an on-going anthology about American history. Marilyn's other credits include some of the best-known films presented by American Experience. She developed the three-part series ""Nixon,"" the first presidential biography produced for the series, and went on to produce and write the third hour, ""The Fall."" Working with a select team, she helped to co-produce the four-hour series ""The Kennedys,"" which remains one of American Experience's most popular programs. More recently Mellowes developed God in America, the six hour series that explores the tumultuous intersection of religion and political life in this country from the first European settlements to the election of 2008. Mellowes served as the Series Producer and was chiefly responsible for guiding its editorial content; she also provided key content for the series web site. A co-production of FRONTLINE and American Experience, God in America premiered in October 2010.",,,Computer science|Film|French|Government & Politics|History|Literature|Religion|Social Science|Writing

I have recently learned from Wolfgang Freitag that the name ""Sick"" came from ""Sieg"" , meaning Victory. I was glad to hear it. We moved to Seattle after prohibition where my father created the Rainier Brewery and bought the baseball team, the Indians, renaming them the Rainiers. Freddy Hutchinson pitched for 25 victories in 1937 before going off to the majors. I attended the University of Washington, graduated from Scripps in Claremont, California, got an MA at Columbia and a PhD at Boston University. I taught French at Concord Academy and at Boston University and wrote my doctoral thesis on Chateaubriand's and Claude Levi-Strauss' literary styles. The latter, an anthropologist, is the father of Structuralism and, at the age of 99, gives hope to the Parisian literati of living to be 100 in November and providing grist for a celebration. I married Robert Minton, a writer and publicist, author of several books, who was head of public relations at Radio Free Europe and Boston University. We spent three years in Paris and three in Munich. We had two children, Cronan and Helena. Cronan has two married children, who each have two children, making me a great grandmother. Helena has one son. Cronan has a small business and Helena is director of the library in North Reading. The ILR has been my major interest for more years than I care to say. In the outside world it is not easy to meet people with as varied interests as our members, although there are a few in Concord, where I live. While I never tire of learning new things, I am now concentrating mainly on languages. It is not a bad idea as they are leading me in new directions. I play the recorder, in case anybody wants to play in a group.

,John,,Morrel,,,,,"7 Addison Street  Arlington, MA 02476",617-515-0060,john.morrel@me.com,,,,,,,"After growing up in the still open country of old farmsteads in southeastern Pennsylvania tramping through the woods and fields shared with foxhunts and not a few artists, I attended Swarthmore College where I got a rude shock about the requirements for serious intellectual endeavor. Fortunately I eventually thrived. I also began to study voice and to perform a bit of chamber music. I received a BA in English literature with minors in history and art and went on to Rutgers for graduate work that resulted in a master's degree. Contradictions abound in my family! I was one of the first babies born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee where my father worked on the Manhattan Project. My Southern parents moved in 1945 to the country near Wilmington, Delaware where my father continued a career with DuPont begun during his college years. Despite my Dad's role in development of the atomic bomb, when I was five my mother brought the family into the Society of Friends (Quaker). The turmoil of the late sixties required a choice about military service. My Quaker background led me to alternative service as a conscientious objector and work in an evolving juvenile justice program in Massachusetts. I went on to found an alternative school for potential high school dropouts and then to more graduate work in public policy at the Florence Heller School for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare at Brandeis. I worked on both the administrative and legislative sides of state government. I joined the new Massachusetts Child Support Enforcement program at its initiation and had the opportunity to play key administrative roles in the development of a critical new government agency, one that raised many challenging issues about the relationship between state and federal governments. Based on the Massachusetts experience, for several years following retirement I worked as a management consultant to other state governments and the City of New York. Until the press of management work and consulting crowded time for practice and rehearsals, I continued my ""alternative career"" working as a soloist with a number of musical groups and church choirs for some twenty-five years. During those same years I restored the 1789 farmhouse, bit by tiny bit, which was a bucolic place for raising two children. A political activist for most of my life, I continue to find ways of supporting civil rights, particularly for communities that are marginalized socially and economically. I have led HILR study groups on the great mid-century Black leader and teacher Bayard Rustin; on gay and lesbian writers here and in Europe following the period of the New York Stonewall Riots; on the remarkable fiction and essays of James Baldwin, products of his painstaking witness to the turmoil in his country from the 1940s through the 1980s; and on the world of immigrants and craftsmen in New York City between 1825 and 1875 as they faced the challenges of blended communities and industrialization in the bustle of ever-evolving Manhattan. Retirement has brought time for more travel and attention to a growing but widely scattered family, my daughters in Rhode Island and California, my own grandchildren and the extended family of my partner, Dick Rubinstein, who quickly built connections for me with family members on three continents. Dick and I share a taste for new adventures and have spent considerable time together in Thailand and Bhutan, the Netherlands, Italy and several parts of France so far, with plenty of future options on the table.",,,Art|Business|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Computer science|Economics|French|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|History|Italian|Literature|Music|Social Science|Theatre|Travel|Writing

Melissa graduated from Wellesley College with a BA in Biblical History. After additional coursework at Harvard Graduate School of Education, she taught fifth grade at private schools. Studying for an MA in Special Education: Education of the Emotionally Disturbed from Teachers College, Columbia University, she was asked to be the student teacher in a new project for behaviorally disordered preschoolers. She loved that work, which started a lifelong career in early childhood special education. Further education added mental health skills to her professional repertoire. She worked in LA, and Washington, D.C. before moving to Palo Alto, CA. While working in Palo Alto, Melissa met her husband, Bill (also an HILR member), who had just begun his radiation oncology residency at Stanford Medical Center. Almost four years later they were married, and moved to Paris, where he had a one-year appointment as a radiation oncologist. She was a foreign intern at a community mental health center, working with a wonderful child psychiatrist/psychoanalyst in programs for the very young. They returned to Palo Alto for one year then moved to Boise, ID, where Melissa was a special education consultant to Head Start and later was on the staff at a mental health center. After 5 years in Boise, the family moved to Toledo, OH, so Bill could join a private practice of radiation oncology. There they remained for over 27 years. While a full-time mother of three, Melissa studied part-time for her PhD in Educational Psychology at the University of Toledo (major in Child Development and minor in Early Childhood Special Education). She was awarded the degree at age 52. After graduation, she re-entered the workforce, working for two Toledo area school systems, as well as supervising student teachers at Bowling Green State University and teaching a graduate special education course at the University of Toledo. Her volunteer work has included years of ""reading mom"" experiences, serving on her church vestry, and tutoring in a high school program for pregnant and parenting teenage girls and a Boston public school kindergarten.

I enjoy a wide variety of study groups, activities, and friends at HILR. I co-led a study group in fall 2005 (with David Singer) on ""Hot Button Issues in Medical Care,"" and I led a course on Alistair Cooke's reports about America in the spring of 2008. From the spring of 2004 to the fall of 2008, I guided a writers' club at HILR. I am the chairman of HILR's Committee on Inclusivity (Diversity Committee).

I love it here, and don't think my wife and I will move or even snowbird to the South. My medical career, after six years of post-graduate medical training, has all been in the Boston area. Thirty years were spent with what is today called ""Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates,"" 15 years at the Kenmore office and 15 years at the Watertown office. This organization pioneered in the East the whole idea of prepaid, capitated, comprehensive, closed panel practice, but over the years has evolved into a more typical multispecialty practice accepting many forms of insurance. Over those years, the whole nature of primary care practice in the USA has changed profoundly. After leaving Harvard Vanguard, I spent 3 1/2 years in a neighborhood health center in the South End with a mainly Spanish-speaking, mainly low-income population. In 1988, I founded a 501(c)(3) organization service the homeless population of Boston in a variety of ways, but mainly medically until 2006. In my medical organizations I was much involved in quality assessment and improvement work, and in medical care organizational leadership. This included about eight years as one of the physicians on the Board of Trustees of Harvard Vanguard involved in value setting and policy decisions, program development and assessment, strategic planning, and ethics reviews.

My professional life has been divided between teaching and lawyering. After a considerable gap (2 kids), I resumed teaching in 1978. My job was in a small private school, with flexible hours, and a chance to develop a really first class American History curriculum. I liked it a great deal; however, after 5 years, I needed to grow, so I enrolled in Northeastern U. Law School. I enjoyed the study of law, but never really liked the practice of law. I have to digress here and say that I never really gave the profession a chance to grow on me, or me grow on it (?) because just as I was beginning the practice, I was diagnosed with a breast tumor, followed 2 years later, by a brain tumor. Distracted by all this, I blundered into a practice that I never enjoyed. I was practicing at the Boston Juvenile Court, and observing, daily, the inability of the Department of Social Services and the Juvenile Court to deal with the wild kingdom of humanity's worst problems that presented itself in Court. After 9 years I resigned, wrote book reflecting my frustrations, Justice at the City Gate (in the HILR library), and never looked back. I am retired! I love it! I am 19 years post breast tumor and 17 years post brain tumor, and aside from arthritis attacks, my health is good. I dabble in politics when I want to, and thanks to HILR I am reading things I always wanted to, but never did. Boring early life: I grew up in a working class suburb in New Jersey.

,Carlos,,Neu,,,,,"14 Longfellow Road  Cambridge, MA 02138",617-354-3533,carlosneu@icloud.com,,,,,,,"I would like to introduce myself to my new community at HILR. I was born in Cali, Colombia in 1942 where my parents had been welcomed after fleeing Austria in 1939. They named me Carlos and not Karl because they hoped that having a Spanish name would protect me better from being discovered by the Nazi regime if it ever made it to Colombia. When I was only a few months old we moved to Bogot__ where I lived until returning to Cali to study medicine. Fast forward to 1968 when I arrived in Miami during the famous National Democratic Convention in Chicago. Thinking that I had arrived in such a civilized country, I found it to be quite disturbing to see how violent the protests and police retaliation were. Had I made the right decision or should I just have remained in Colombia? Obviously I stayed and went from Miami to Boston to begin my residency in psychiatry. I trained at Boston State Hospital which at the time, much like Mass Mental Health, was still a psychoanalytic academic center but rapidly taken over by the nascent psychopharmacology and community psychiatry metamorphosis. After four years of residency I became a fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and subsequently became a member of a multi-national research team studying major mental illness. My most delightful job while at MGH was being the Chairman of Grand Rounds. Not only did I get to invite guests of my choosing but it was a most awesome experience to be running these rounds from the Ether Dome. But in 1979 I decided that research psychiatry was not really where I wanted to spend the rest of my career. An HMO, a new concept then, known back then as Harvard Community Health Plan or HCHP offered me a position at their Cambridge location. At the same time I became a codirector of the Mount Auburn Hospital inpatient psychiatric service. In 1999 I decided that I needed to make one more career change, namely offering my clinical skills to the Hispanic community of Boston as well as to the people without or limited insurance. I wanted to use my cultural and language skills with a population that was deprived because of limited resources. The Arbour Hospital in Jamaica Plain offered me this opportunity. It was a rewarding and rich experience which I brought to an end when I decided to retire in June of 2016. On a personal note, I have been married to my wife, Judi, for nearly 48 years. We have two adult children. Both are married. Our son lives in Chicago and our daughter and her husband and our two grandchildren live nearby. Being a grandfather has been the joy of my life. I am Jewish and have studied and taken buddhist vows. I have been a photographer since I had my first ""brownie"" camera when my age was still counted in single digits. We love the out doors, gardening, cooking, eating out and love theatre, ballet and movies. I am very excited to enter this new phase of my life at HILR where I have already experienced the richness of a community of peers eager to learn, explore and share.",,,Art|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Film|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|History|Literature|Medicine|Religion|Social Science|Spanish|Sports|Theatre

She received a BA in American history from U.C. and, after a year in Europe and a variety of odd jobs, began a PhD program in European history at Boston University. She completed her qualifying exams before finally facing up to the grim realities of the academic job market, left school, and with almost no computer experience drifted into the world of high tech as a documentation writer. She spent more than 15 years as a writer and documentation manager, mostly at Lotus Development Corporation. During that time, she received Masters degrees in both Education and Public Health from B.U. In 2000, with her daughter safely out of college, she was finally able to return to her interests in promoting social justice. She worked for two years at state health agencies and then joined The Access Project, a small non-profit dedicated to advocating for affordable health care for vulnerable populations, where she remained for ten years. As a policy analyst and policy director at the organization, she researched and wrote about a variety of health-related topics, with a primary emphasis on the causes, scope, and consequences of medical debt for health-care consumers. One of her final reports was an analysis, funded by the Kaiser Family Foundation, of Massachusetts consumers' experiences getting health care after the passage of the state's health care reform law. In addition to her career, Carol has remained active in local political organizations, working on issues such as ending U.S. support for the Salvadoran government during the 1980s civil war, supporting progressive state income taxes in Massachusetts, and campaigning for progressive political candidates.

My son, Eric, joined me five years ago and this has allowed me to practice on a part time basis. Preparing for this career path started in Brooklyn where I had a classical public school education. My four years at Columbia College majoring in American History was followed by four years at Harvard Medical School. Before starting my ophthalmology residency at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, I was a general medical officer on the Navajo Reservation near Monument Valley Arizona. Fran, my wife and I are excited to be new members of HILR. Besides my son Eric, I have a daughter Deborah, an artist. They both have two children. My interests are varied and range from traveling, music, reading, tennis and anything academically challenging. I have taught high school at private schools in New York and Massachusetts. I am on the faculty of Harvard and Tufts Medical School and I am a premedical tutor at one the houses at Harvard College. All through my life I met mentors, teachers and friends who have guided me. My biologic mother died when I was 6 months old and my father remarried when I was three. My biologic uncle essentially 'home schooled' me by way mail. He sent me annotated- age-appropriate copies of the great classics. Every month, I received books wrapped in brown paper bags until I graduated from high school. This guided tour of the classics stimulated my interest in literature as well as challenging my curiosity. My Advanced Biology teacher in high school assisted my research as a finalist in the Westinghouse Science Talent Finals. That award provided me with the opportunity to study at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. At Columbia, I majored in American History courses taught by Richard Hofstadter, William Leuchtenburg, James P Shenton, Benjamin Wishy and my advisor Henry Graff. I also studied Russian foreign policy with Alexander Dallin and Zbigniew Bzezinski. My senior thesis concentrated on the surprise bombing of the USS Panay on the Yangtze River (a harbinger of the attack on Pearl Harbor). At Harvard Medical School, I worked in Dr. George Thorn's lab on the early endocrine study of steroids. I also became a member of the Bolyston Society, the oldest medical society in the United States. My senior thesis was mentored by Dr. John Nemiah, Chairperson of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. The topic of the paper was the history of the Evil Eye and Superstitions. At the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, I was the Howe resident, which was the academic position in the residency at Harvard Medical School. At present I am tutoring 8th graders from the Boston school systems in an enrichment program at Beacon Academy. I have served in the past as an officer and Board member of my synagogue, my medical and opthalmologic societies and my hospital.

I have spent my adult life as an art consultant, community volunteer and organizer. I have a corporate art consulting business, portfolio art consultants, where I advised on corporate collections, and helped artists build professional careers. My personal areas of interest are especially focused on folk, outsider art and Judaica. I spearheaded the founding of a the Wyner museum at Temple Israel of Boston. I spent many years volunteering in a variety of positions at the synagogue and became it's first woman president in 1989. After 135 years it decided that we could have a voice in governance.

,William,,Ritz,,,,,"150 Hampshire St, #1  Cambridge, MA 02139",617-945-2836,nwmritz@gmail.com,,,,,,,"My hometown was Youngstown, Ohio. During the booming fifties, Youngstown was a large manufacturing center. I well remember the bessemer furnaces throwing flames high into the evening sky turning it red as steel ingots were produced in the mills. In addition to basic steel, many finishing plants produced products that were shipped worldwide. Times were great and plenty of work was available for all who applied and joined a union. My Italian father was a barber. I was reared as a first generation Italian American. My goal was to advance beyond the trades in a factory center and work as a community professional serving the public. Ohio State University, the state's flagship acedemic and sports magnet beckoned. In five years I graduated with a B.S. in Physiological Optics as well as with a B.S. in Optometry. At twenty two I was the youngest in my class to obtain both degrees. While at Ohio State I met the love of my life, Nancy Burns, a home economics teacher. We married and had our first child Nick, before my graduation. From Columbus, OH we moved on to the University of Houston, College of Optometry where I worked as a clinical instructor and earned my Doctor of Optometry degree. After passing national and state boards, adventure led us to London England. There I worked as a technical editor for the Hatten Press. We published a weekly journal The Ophthalmic and Dispensing Optician that circulated throughout the commonwealth. When our second child Dan was due, we felt it best to return to the U.S. I then went into clinical practice in Jacksonville, FL. An opportunity to buy a small professional practice enabled us to move to Ocala, FL. My daughter Patty was born and my lovely wife gave up teaching to rear the children. The move to Ocala was fruitfull as Ocala and Marion County grew from 25,000 in 1963 to today's 340,000. The popularity of home air conditioning has made it an ideal retirement community. I became fully involved in community work in Ocala. I chaired many educational committies as well as leading a number of service and church organizations. The Florida Governor appointed me the Board of Trustees of Central Florida Community College. I served the Board for thirteen years and chaired it for four. In 1973 I was awarded the Marion County Distinguished Service award. Over the years my participation in optometric professional organizations enabled me to Chair the Florida Vision Service Program (Prepaid Vision Insurance), the North Central Florida Optometric Society as well as the Florida Optometric Trust. Meanwhile my small optometric practice grew to be a primary eye care clnic with four doctors and twenty four employees. We also built a wholesale optical laboratory, Ritz Optics, which served central Florida. My interest in real estate enabed me to provide rental homes and commercial offices for three dozen famiies and businesses in the Gainesville and Ocala communities. This was not only an excellant investment, but taught me a great deal about home repairs and human relations. My hobbies included competitive four wall handball, collecting and restoring antique automobiles, astronomy, astrophysics, and teaching Sunday School at church. My wife is an amateur artist and enjoys accompanying me in european travel. I have also enjoyed sightseeing in China. Both of my sons are actively practicing optometry. Dan in Ocala, FL and Nick in Albuquerque, NM. My daughter has worked on staff at Harvard University and now is a full time professor at Northeastern University.

The world was happy to support this aspiration, since shortly thereafter the Russians launched Sputnik. My career didn't play out that way, because at Caltech I found that modern physics is no longer about the visceral and palpable, but the abstract and mathematical. But I've retained a strong interest in science, completing my BS degree at Caltech in Engineering, and then a PhD in Social Sciences at UC Irvine. What does such an education qualify me for? For some years I explored working in computer art, computers in education, computer-aided problem solving. My eventual answer was user interface design: designing technology from the outside in_from people, their abilities, knowledge, and needs_to create software and gizmos that work, solve problems, and make sense to users. I have worked at high-tech companies, including Bolt Beranek and Newman, Digital Equipment Corporation, Sun Microsystems, Human Factors International, and a couple of high-tech startups.

In teaching various forms of writing: academic writing, creative writing, and some literature courses, she takes great satisfaction in employing a deep, life-long (almost) interest in the writing process. Her students are working adults, most with families, who have returned to college with the determination to make their lives, and the lives of their children, better through education. Anne uses her own experience of returning to college in her mid-thirties, with a family to care for, to create a welcoming class environment, and reduce the mystique of writing in general, and in academic writing specifically. After graduating from UMASS Boston with a B.A. in English, and a minor in Psychology in 1980, Anne completed her Master's in English Literature the following year. Having been awarded a Danforth Fellowship to support graduate school, she attended Harvard's Graduate School of Education. There, she encountered Robert Kegan's theoretical framework: Constructive-Developmental Psychology. The theory offers a perspective on adult development that Anne sees as inviting ways of understanding and implementing the teaching of writing. These are connections that she continues to explore with every classroom experience. Anne has six children, all married, and twelve grand-children. She thinks there ought to be a special clause in some parent-child contract that says ""You promise to live within a 2-hour drive from your mother."" Her children are scattered in four different directions: much further than two hours away. Raising the children, largely on her own, Anne has a profound appreciation for how much she learned from watching them grow. She realizes that they were her first ""laboratory"" in understanding how people learn, and asking: what helps and what hinders? Her grandchildren range from 19 months to 23 years old, and thanks to technology, she is still, joyfully, watching them all grow.",,,HILR Curriculum|History|Literature|Medicine|Technology|Writing

I consulted widely to industry and started two companies. I retired from MIT in 2013, and in 2010, we sold our last start-up (Polychromix) to FischerScientific. I am now 100% done with technology. If an email sounds like my old field, I delete before reading.

I'm also writing fiction. My first novel, One Man's Purpose, was published in 2015, and I'm well into the sequel, tentatively titled Cross Purposes. I'm hoping it will see the light of day in 2018. HILR has given me the chance to return to the broader educational goals of my undergraduate years and the opportunity to meet new friends.

I'm a clarinetist, specializing in chamber music, and I give concerts from time to time, whenever the occasion and my musical companions permit. Having spent 36 years in academia, most of it involving committees of one sort or another, I'm not all that interested in committee service within HILR My goal instead is to try to make every study group I participate in, whether as leader or member, as rewarding an experience as possible, for me, and for everyone.

As President of the Board of Trustees at the Lexington Montessori School I instituted one of the first extended day and day care programs in the Boston area. That experience inspired me to return to school and receive a MBA from Boston University. At business school I enjoyed collaborative learning in discussions using the case method, and it has been the center of all my favorite experiences since. My business degree was invaluable in my chosen industry ___ publishing- because I could understand and contribute to many departments ___ marketing, finance, editorial. I began my publishing career as book trade sales manager for a press that had been serving the research needs of libraries. There I directed the company's entry into the retail book trade market with large print books. I left to start my own company which specialized in marketing and distributing titles published by non-profit organizations focused on history and nature. I sold my company to Independent Publishers Group, the second largest book distributor in the country. There I developed the international rights program and for twenty years negotiated and managed the translation of titles from 300 innovative publishers into many different languages.

These firsts played out in her career in various ways. She loved every minute at Bryn Mawr, but her pleasure was tempered by the fact that her mother, simply because she was a woman, had been denied the higher education she craved. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, she clerked for Bailey Aldrich, Chief Judge of the First Circuit. The deciding factor in landing the clerkship was not that she had edited the law review at Penn. Rather, the judge's mother and wife were Bryn Mawr grads, and Raya S. Dreben had already clerked for him, dispelling any qualms about female competence. About to offer Sandra her next job, the Managing Partner at Foley Hoag organized the obligatory luncheon at the Harvard Club. However, the hostess wouldn't seat the party because the guest of honor was a woman. The year was 1970. Fifteen years later Sandra was President of the Women's Bar Association of Massachusetts. She spearheaded the drive to obtain funding from the legislature for the Gender Bias Study of the Court System in Massachusetts, and she helped coordinate the study. It uncovered system-wide gender inequities in the administration of family law, criminal and juvenile justice, civil damage awards, and courthouse hiring and compensation. In her legal practice Sandra specialized in urban development for public agencies. For twenty years she counseled the agency that developed the 24-acre Cambridge Center adjoining Kendall Square and MIT. She was appointed by the Governor to the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Government Land Bank, and by the Supreme Judicial Court to the Board of Bar Overseers. She remains of counsel at Foley Hoag. In international practice Sandra traveled widely as Foley Hoag's contact with Lex Mundi, a world-wide network of 160 law firms that cooperate in providing their respective clients with expert counsel in foreign jurisdictions. As a Lex Mundi officer, EC member, and real-estate practice-group chair, Sandra was also active in vetting firms applying for Lex Mundi membership and in mentoring female lawyers. In the cultural realm Sandra was an overseer of the New England Conservatory and Boston Lyric Opera, and chaired the overseers of Celebrity Series of Boston. At Harvard Extension School she improved her Italian and studied Greek literature in translation under Gregory Nagy and the late Charles Segal. She also completed Hebrew College's two-year Me'ah program under Shaye Cohen and Marc Brettler. For twenty years she has led a monthly reading group in her home, often hosting local authors.

After having been a somewhat unappreciative teacher for so many years, she was interested to discover how much it is that Principals actually do! After their year at Parker, she and Ted also taught a year-long course in school design at the Harvard Graduate School of Education between 2000 and 2006. Her books reflect her longstanding interest in China (China: Tradition and Change), in moral dilemmas (Making Decisions) and in the senior year of high school (Crossing the Stage: Redesigning Senior Year).

,Stanley,,Smith,,,,,  ,978-745-0658,sajsmith@verizon.net,,,,,,,"Stanley retired in 2004 after 25 years as the Executive Director of Historic Boston Incorporated. Among his accomplishments were the acquisition and restoration of the Hayden Building in Boston's Combat Zone and the creation of Boston's Steeples Project. H. H. Richardson designed and built the Hayden Building while he was also creating Trinity Church in Boston's Copley Square. To replace the sex industry activities which had been the primary tenants of the Hayden Building since the Second World War, Historic Boston secured Boston's first Malaysian Restaurant and a bank as new tenants for this historic site. The Steeples Project grew out of major struggles in the late 1980s to save a Jesuit church in the South End and Boston's last old synagogue on the north slope of Beacon Hill. Stanley thought there needed to be a more proactive approach to preserving exceptional religious properties when demographic changes and deferred maintenance endanger them. Arguing that steeples, towers, and domes punctuate the skyline, define places and neighborhoods, and often mark the site of vital community services, Stanley raised money to establish a competitive matching grant program for religious property owners, called the Steeples Project. More than 50 religious property owners in Boston have now received grants from $10,000 to $50,000 to assess the conditions and needs of their buildings, carry out building envelope repairs, and illuminate them. Stanley and his wife have lived in Salem, MA, since 1973. Both of their children were born and brought up there. With his son, Stanley went to the Middle East last November, visiting friends in the United Arab Emirates, Syria, Jordan, and Israel. The motivating force for this journey was his rediscovery, via the Internet, of a close Tunisian friend who teaches English at Al Hosn University in Abu Dhabi. The two of them had met in the 1964 when Stanley was studying North African and Islamic Sociology at the University of Tunis, while also acting as study director for American students there from the University of Southern California.

One of my fond memories of my mother is how she tacked onto to the wall of her bedroom the pennant of every college or university her children and grandchildren attended. I attended college at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. There I got an electrical engineering degree through a work study program sponsored by the Navy Department. Just after Sputnik had been sent up by the USSR the country wanted engineers, and I worked part-time at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and had my education expenses subsidized by the government. After graduation from Pratt, I married my wife, Rosemarie. We then moved to Arlington, Massachusetts, while I attended Harvard Law School. Rosemarie supported us while I went to law school by teaching in the Arlington public school system. I graduated in 1966, and began a career as an intellectual property lawyer, working at firms and corporations in the Boston area.

Still living upon memories of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid robbing it's one small bank only to be pursued out of town by, Fred Crukshank, deputy sheriff in hot pursuit on his bicycle, it was having trouble adjusting to a terrible war which was becoming an American reality even in the hinterlands and was bringing with it ""the railroad men"" who worked in its small depot, roundhouse, and repair facilities, men who drank hard liquor and smoked cigarettes and did not attend church services as did its upright Mormon founders less than a hundred years before, settlers and their descendants who followed the Word of Wisdom and still believed that black people bore the mark of Cain upon themselves which precluded their participation in the church hierarchy. It was the world of Edgar Lee Masters and the Spoon River Anthology and certainly not of James Joyce with his degenerate and thankfully almost incomprehensible Ulysses. It was a place where a young freshman girl in high school could be threatened with being expelled for turning in a book report on Peyton Place. It was a place of magnificently beautiful vistas from mountain tops that could literally make the heart stop, skip a beat, and almost refuse to settle down in the presence of such spendour. It was a place of cumulus clouds playing in heavens so blue that medieval masters painting the virgin's cloak with the finest ultramarine would have blushed with shame at their muddy colors. It was a place of abject poverty and grueling hand to mouth existence. It was my world. It was a place from which a determined high school teacher at first suggested, then cajoled, and ultimately hectored me into submitting an application to Harvard University. Books that I accumulated on trips to Salt Lake City some 200 miles away, books by a crazy doctor from Vienna whose name I thought certainly had to be pronounced Frood and who I felt was either a true genius or perhaps the greatest practitioner of mental prestidigitation every seen, a most prized book by Karl Popper on the Logic of Scientific Discovery which I had to read over and over and yet over once again to make sense of (a book to this day which still serves me well in understanding the magnificent edifice of modern science and its extraordinary shortcomings), and to me at that point the totally incomprehensible Ethics of Spinoza which remained a mystery for another score of years, increasingly all teamed up with my high school teacher lending their support; and so, the application went in and to my amazement I was accepted. In 1959, I set off upon a four year journey of absolute amazement, an adventure called Harvard College that would rival the wildest travels of Marco Polo or Magellan, or Bougainvillae, or Ibn Battuta. John Finlay, master of Eliot House and one of the planners of the general education program at Harvard College, once told me that the real idea behind general education was to take the bright eyed an bushy tailed young men from the mid-west or west who came to college and to immerse them in the dark world of Kafka, confuse them through encounters with other people from other times, and astound them with new sciences that would crack apart their tidy little world views while the prematurely sophisticated students from elite prep schools who knew Kafka and Sartre backward and forward would have to spend time reading Edna St. Vincent Millay's Ballad of the Harp Weaver and such like. ""You see, he said, it isn't our job so much to teach them the way the world is---our job is to shake them up---bright as they are, they will find a way about---and then they will teach us new ways the world is."" After being totally and wonderfully ""shaken up"" by college, but still interested in the Viennese doctor whose name I had by then at least learned to pronounce correctly, I decided I wanted to go to medical school and become a psychiatrist, more specifically a psychoanalyst. For the next four years I had to do battle with myself trying to fit within the clearly circumscribed ways of thinking at Harvard Medical School. Feeling that it simply would not work and submitting my letter of resignation at one point, I was saved from a catastrophic error on my part through a conversation with the then dean of the medical school, Robert Ebert. Dispassionate, as no one else I found at the time regarding my decision, he helped me clarify my priorities as opposed to those of the school and suggested that I approach the problem from the perspective of considering whether it could provide me in the long run sufficient tools to become the person I hoped to be. Suggesting that I take a year off to review my decision, a plan that led to my returning, in the course of one conversation of perhaps a half hour, he changed my life. It was in my psychiatric residency at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center that I began to become aware of the absolutely terrible condition of mental health service delivery in our country. It was a time when most people conceived of psychiatry as the practice of talk therapy between two highly civilized individuals. It was a time when the good citizens of Boston simply ""didn't realize"" that some thirty miles from their doorsteps there were buildings called hospitals where ""care"" was being administered for a grand total of $24/day, where just inside the doors of one female admission unit one could usually see a poor woman essentially naked prolapsing her rectum with her fingers and usually lying in that doorway in a pool of blood, where patients had to sleep in linen returned as ""freshly laundered"" but caked with fecal material, where totally docile patients were often locked away in a single ward for decades and more. Thoughts of becoming a psychoanalyst became increasingly distant as I became more and more preoccupied with issues of patient care delivery systems. Those thoughts were also given up as the psychoanalytic community increasingly voiced its stance of having no use for someone such as myself who was seen by them as psychiatrically unstable in view of his sexual orientation. Finishing my residency, I accepted a position as Director of the Cambridge-Somerville Unit of the Westboro State Hospital for Harvard's Cambridge Hospital Department of Psychiatry, a position that my best friends thought I was as crazy as the patients within to accept, a position where I suddenly found myself in charge of more patients than had been in the entire hospital wherein I had trained. Among the unit staff, we had a ""doctor"" who identified a scalp tumor as ""dirt behind the ear"", a ""doctor"" who administered unacceptable doses of medications to patients to see if their recovery couldn't be hurried along, a poor soul who jumped off of a table in a belief that he might be able to fly, and a ""doctor"" concerning whom there were the gravest suspicions that hospital barbiturates were being abused. The staff was not stellar. But sprinkled amidst these there were truly some magnificent nurses, women, for the most part, who provided comforting care against all odds. Professionally, I devoted myself more and more to program development and teaching. In the former, I participated in the movement of patients warehoused in the ""hospital"" to community residences with follow-up care by an ambulatory community service, the establishment of a required residency rotation at the hospital for Harvard residents in the Cambridge Department of Psychiatry, and the review of inappropriate deinstitutionalization which in many cases led to patients from the mental health hospitals to be incarcerated in prisons in turn. After two years there, I was asked to become the director of the office of quality assurance for the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health and instituted the first (and only) statewide review of the quality of every mental health program for which the Department of Mental Health provided funds. Hot potatoes, ah yes, hot potatoes---another such review never occurred! After leaving the Department of Mental Health I helped establish and became the medical director of the Schiff Day Treatment Center for psychiatric patients admitted directly to the program from hospital emergency rooms as an alternative to inpatient state hospitalization. Joining the relatively new Harvard Community Health Plan (HCHP), I helped establish and become the medical director for the first Day Treatment Program of a similar sort that had been set up in a managed health care program in the US, developing programs for the early identification and treatment of depression in primary care settings, etc. etc. until I began to wind down my medical practice accepting the co-directorship of the Inpatient and Day Treatment Substance Abuse Services for the Brigham and Women's Hospital programs at the Faulkner Hospital. At that same time and as important, or perhaps even more importantly, involvement with teaching endeavors played a major role in my work throughout my career. Early on, I taught introductory psychiatry classes for the Cambridge Hospital Department of Psychiatry Residency Program and included non-resident mental health providers as well as MD's in the course. A similar course was given for many years at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. It was also modified and given at Harvard College for several years. And to my surprise, I found that I was the one chosen to give Harvard Medical Students their introductory lectures on psychiatry focusing on psychoanalytic theory and methodology though I could not become a psychoanalyst myself. When I joined the Harvard Community Health Plan (HCHP), I helped establish a psychiatric medical student rotation there and directed it for many years. As the Harvard Medical School began its plans for a New Pathways program, I was lucky enough to be chosen as a member of the HCHP planning committee for the new psychiatric curriculum. Subsequently, along with a colleague, James Sabin, MD, from HCHP I became one of the central committee to plan the new Harvard Longwood Psychiatric Residency Program and was an associate director for many years. During my last years of active practice, I was able to plan for and establish a residency rotation specifically focused upon the recognition and treatment of substance abuse disorders. Throughout my many years of practice, I was fortunate enough to work with many many individual residents in one to one supervision, supervisions during which I am sure I learned much more than I was able to teach. Once I implemented the decision to retire, I found that I now had a chance to read and study and understand the crazy Viennese physician I had discovered in high school in a way I never had before, to revel in Spinoza as the towering genius he was, to be confused and overawed by Abraham Isaac Kook, to tell myself after many attempts at approaching it that I just might be beginning to understand Karl Marx's Das Kapital, to revel in the novels of Stephan Zweig, and on and on and on----- Oh, and by the way, there is gardening, and cycling, and cooking with Patricia Wells but all that is another story.",,,Art|Business|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Climate Change & Ecology|Computer science|Economics|HILR Curriculum|History|Literature|Medicine|Music|Physical Science|Social Science|Travel

The first was directing and choreographing the first B-School Show. Second, while there were fancy, expensive student cars in the parking lot, she was the only classmate with a plane parked at Logan. Having grown up in an entrepreneurial, international business (Stephenson Corporation manufactured resuscitation equipment, the Breathalyzer and radar speed traps.) she felt an affinity for innovative, early stage companies. After HBS, Dorothy had a small consulting business based in Lausanne, Switzerland with an office in Cambridge that assisted with strategic planning, market research, financing through individuals and venture capital, technology transfer, joint ventures and alliances in the U.S. and Europe. In 1976, Dorothy founded the Inventors' Association of New England that still meets at MIT. She also created Inventors' Weekend at the Museum of Science that broke all daily attendance records each of the twelve years that it ran. She was responsible for the entire show including exhibits, speakers, and TV publicity appearances. For the Department of Energy, Dorothy designed their National Innovation Workshops that ran for fifteen years in various locations around the country. A component of her reason to have a consulting business rather than work for a company was that her husband died in 1981, when their sons were ages one and two. The boys are in their mid-30s.

,Polly,,Stevens,,,,,  ,,stevensp1939@yahoo.com,,,,,,,"Polly grew up in South Jersey, in the Philadelphia area. She majored in science at George School, a Quaker boarding school north of Philadelphia, but for college, she opted for left-leaning, Bohemian Antioch College in Ohio over Quaker-rooted Swarthmore College. At the time, Antioch's cooperative work program had a coop job with Woods Hole Oceanographic, and Polly had airy ideas of becoming a marine biologist. At Antioch, however, under the influences of courses and coop jobs, Polly turned to a major in psychology. Many years later, the first spring of her retirement found her finally living out part of her marine biologist dream_walking the shores of the Boston Harbor Islands at dawn looking for local fauna. On graduation she headed to New York City where for two years she did research in child development. Accepted at the University of Chicago for her doctorate in psychology, she opted instead to explore, taking her savings and hitchhiking through Europe for five months. She settled in Boston on her return and has lived here since the mid-60s. Polly's experience in child development led to her involvement in Head Start. She moved to the Commonwealth Service Corps, Massachusetts's arm of the anti-poverty program, and became a specialist in preschool education, parent involvement in public education, and welfare rights. In her early thirties, she decided on a career in law and received her J.D. degree from Northeastern University where she was briefly known as the poet laureate for writing a take-home property law exam in verse. Experience in the Northeastern Law coop program led to her misguided decision to do civil litigation in a Boston law firm. After cutting the disaster short, she had the good fortunate to be hired by the newly formed Massachusetts Appeals Court. Polly spent the rest of her working life, some thirty years, as a senior staff attorney there and editor of the judges' opinions. Inexpensive and usually solo travel is one of her greatest loves, most recently in the Balkans, Armenia and Georgia. In retirement, she does bird censusing in the Boston Harbor Islands for the Park Service and takes courses here and there.",,,Biological Science|Civil Rights & Social Justice|Computer science|Government & Politics|Literature|Medicine|Physical Science|Travel|Writing

He graduated from Dartmouth in 1970 and then pursued graduate work at UC-Santa Barbara and the University of Chicago. He received his Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from Chicago in 1976, where he pursued interdisciplinary work in anthropology, sociology, and linguistics, as well as in psychology. After a postdoctoral period at the Center for Psychosocial Studies in Chicago, he joined the faculty of Communication Sciences & Disorders at Northwestern University, where he taught courses on cognitive and social development and supervised graduate clinical training in the areas of learning and language disabilities. During that time, his research was focused on individual differences in cognitive and language development. He was also active in administrative roles at both the departmental and university levels. While at Northwestern, Addison met and married a fellow faculty member, Joanne Carlisle, who will also be joining HILR in January 2015. In 2000, Addison and Joanne accepted offers to move to the University of Michigan, where they joined the faculty in the School of Education. Addison's work during his final years at Northwestern and at Michigan shifted increasingly towards social supports for atypical children as well as developmental theory. In addition, despite his best intentions, he once again became enmeshed in administration. In 2012, Addison and Joanne retired from Michigan and relocated to Cambridge. The move allowed them to be closer to family (two sons' families in the western suburbs) and to their long-time second home in the Litchfield Hills of Connecticut. They now divide their time between the two venues. When in CT, Addison pursues his passions for gardening and nature (hiking, birding) as well as doing volunteer work for Habitat for Humanity. When in Cambridge, he devotes some time to volunteer tutoring of middle-school students in the Cambridge public schools. In addition, he and Joanne attend frequent classical music concerts. They also take advantage of all opportunities to interact with their 4 grandchildren. In his spare time, Addison is beginning to catch up on the fiction that he left behind when professional duties took over years ago. He alternates among mystery/espionage, classic literature, and recent novels, particularly those of the post-modern ilk.

Right after Wellesley Susan spent two years in Japan, where she had wanted to go since she was nine, when a Japanese Radcliffe student lived with her family, read her Japanese tales of ogres and samurai and supervised her piano practice. Returning to Buffalo, NY Susan worked in market research for a manufacturing company (the first non-clerical female employee) and then, after Martin Luther King was assassinated and Jefferson Ave. burned, for the Buffalo Human Relations Commission. Following a move to Andover, MA, Susan worked as a planner for the City of Lawrence and then returned to school for an MCRP.

Harvard was good to me, and so I stayed for medical school. Another benefit of being in Boston was that I met Linda, a very special young woman from Wellesley College who is still my wife after 48 years. Now we have three children and 4 grand children. After my internship in Michigan, we moved to Guatemala City for two years where I was a public health service officer detailed to the Peace Corps. Our first child was born in Guatemala the month after we arrived. The Guatemala experience confirmed for me an interest in overpopulation as a problem, and career choice to go into obstetrics and gynecology with the expectation that I would work in international health and family planning. We returned to Boston for my residency at Boston Hospital for Women, and then I stayed on in academic obstetrics and gynecology at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Mass. General, and then was recruited to the Mount Auburn as Chief of Ob/Gyn. During these years Linda produced our third child, and also earned her second master's degree, in Social Work and started a career in Psychiatric Social Work which she still pursues. Out next adventure was Maine. I became Ob/Gyn Chief at the Maine Medical Center where we enjoyed 6 years before Boston University offered me the opportunity to be Chair of Ob/Gyn for the medical school and Chief of the department at Boston City Hospital as it became Boston Medical Center. I retired from the hospital at the end of 2008, but have continued to be active in family planning, working with two international agencies in several third world countries, working as a physician for the Planned Parenthood League of MA clinics, editing a series of medical texts and reviewing training programs and research proposals for the Fellowships in Family Planning. Also, Linda and I spend most Fridays in Providence being mother's helpers for our daughter's twins. As I was thinking about retiring from the hospital and worrying about filling my time, Linda advised me that the world would find me things to do. It has, though sometimes the things seem to need doing all at the same time.

She taught first at Indiana University and then the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Upon retiring in 2008, she moved to Boston to be nearer family and friends, as well as for the challenge of meeting new people. A specialist in nineteenth-century British literature and history, she has published books and articles on working-class literature, Victorian women, nineteenth-century theatre, and the history of sexuality. She spent many years serving on a variety of university committees; she helped to found Indiana's Women's Studies Program and to create tenure-track positions for Michigan's WS Program. In addition she served as chair of Michigan's Women's Studies Program, the Department of English and the Sweetland Writing Center. Since moving to Boston, Martha has been able to travel more (most recently to the Antarctic, which is every bit as wonderful as its reputation), and to take up birding more seriously. Too bad she has no ear for bird songs and poor visual memory! She is also an avid kayaker, and remembers with great fondness kayaking among the white/green/blue icebergs of the Antarctic. She retains a long-standing fascination with British history and the city of London, where she spent so much time as a student.

,Francine,,Wacht,,,,,"225 Walden St. 1C  Cambridge, MA. 02140",617-864-4252,fran.author@gmail.com,,,,,,,"Although a native New Yorker, Fran has felt at home in Boston for many years. After earning her B.A. in English Literature from Boston University, and her M.A.T. from New York University, she began teaching high school English in New Jersey. Although instruction in grammar, vocabulary, and composition was necessary, and sometimes even enjoyable, Fran's favorite part of teaching was the opportunity to study and discuss literary works with her students. Sometimes she took classes to nearby Manhattan to see related films and plays, and the most memorable response to these outings was from a student who saw Franco Zeffirelli's film version of Romeo and Juliet. ""Wow,"" he exclaimed on his way out of the theater. ""I thought I lived in a tough neighborhood!"" While Fran continued to enjoy her work, she found it much more demanding and time-consuming than she had expected, and she wondered how the nation's teachers managed to handle the work load. Soon, however, she found the answer in her own classroom; and from then on, whenever she felt overwhelmed by the constant lesson planning, paper grading, conferences, and meetings, she would think about Jimmy G. He was an underachieving high school senior whom she had sought to make aware of his academic and personal potential. Fran seated him right in front of her desk and made sure he challenged himself. Jimmy worked hard all year and did well. On the last day of school, when he passed Fran in the hallway, he silently slipped her a note and then kept walking. The note read, in part, ""You made a scholar out of me. Thank you."" Those words kept Fran in the teaching profession for forty years, over thirty of which were at Brookline (MA) High School. She still has Jimmy's note. In 1986, the publication of Fran's book, I Remember:An AutobiographyText, led to numerous presentations and workshops at local, state, regional, and national conferences on education. As she was writing her book, which contains pieces by students, faculty members, and published authors, Fran was fortunate to meet with some of the autobiographers whose work she had excerpted, including Elie Wiesel, Eudora Welty, Edward Rivera, and Senator Paul Tsongas. In addition, she had the pleasure of corresponding with others whose writing is in her book, such as Russell Baker and Donald Murray. In the fall of 1988, Fran became a Lucretia Crocker Fellow for the Massachusetts Department of Education and spent a year traveling throughout the Commonwealth, conferring with teachers and administrators on the teaching of autobiographical writing. Visiting numerous schools in urban, suburban, and rural areas was a treat, as was talking with students in these schools. Retirement has offered Fran the opportunity to see faraway family and friends more frequently; to do volunteer work (especially for WBUR fundraising); to provide private tutoring in both English and SAT preparation; to see more films and visit more museums; and of course to read more literature. She has even had time to carry out her long-delayed plan to subscribe to The New Yorker. Best of all, she can do any of the above whenever she pleases, even on a school night. Now happily ensconced in HILR, Fran is back in the classroom, but this time she is sharing the space exclusively with post-adolescents.",,,Business|Film|French|HILR Curriculum|History|Literature|Physical Science|Theatre|Travel|Writing
,Clara,,Wainwright,,,,,"11 Blackstone St  Cambridge, MA 02139",617-787-7778,clarawainwright@comcast.net,,,,,,,"Clara Wainwright grew up in Boston in the staid forties and fifties. A poor student, she was told by her college advisor that she wouldn't get into any of her choices. This remark sank deep into her psyche and emerged as a fighting spirit, determined to succeed. (She was accepted at Connecticut College and graduated from the University of North Carolina !). Clara found her real teachers after college ___ Hanns Swarzenski, the Curator of Decorative Arts and Sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts, where she worked ashis secretary. He taught her how to find delight in scholarship and encouraged her to study to become a curator. Ben Thompson, Chairman of the Department of Architecture at Harvard, taught her how to deeply enjoy the simple life through comfortable elegant design, to bring friends and their ideas together with good cooking and a round table. Drew Hyde, the Director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, taught her to trust her intuition and how to do big, ambitious things on a shoestring. And Bill Wainwright, her collaborator for almost fifty years, always encouraged her wildest ideas and collaborated with her to bring them to life. Clara discovered her artist life in 1971when a friend gave her newborn son, Dedalus, an extraordinary Victorian crazy quilt. She found a woman willilng to give a two hour workshop, found a studio not far from home and has spent the past 43 years delighted in every day. She had her first one woman show in 1975 at the Addison Gallery at Phillips Academy in Andover. A number of other shows and retrospectives at the DeCordova Museum and the Cape Ann Museum followed. Her work is in the Museum of Fine Arts, the Peaody Essex Museum, the Cape Ann Museum and Central European University, a well as a number of corporate and private collections. In addition to her own work, Clara has worked with more than fifty community groups on collaborative quilts which explore their ambitions, histories and achievements. These quilts hang in libraries, community and health centers, public housing projects and schools in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Lynn,and Gloucester. This spring she is working with a group of women with Syrian, Iraqi and Egyptian backgrounds on a quilt focusing on Syrian children which will hang in the Center for Arabic Culture in Somerville. With her husband Bill, Clara started the Great Boston Kite Festival in 1969. Held on the golf course in Franklin Park, Dorchester, it was run for 13 years by the Committee for the Better Use of Air until the City of Boston took it over. In 1976 she started First Night, Boston's artists' ideas or how to usher in the new year. She still marches in the Grand Procession, in full costume, giving out silver stickers as a member of the Geometric Progression Band. Last spring, in response to the Marathon tragedy, Clara and a collaborator created a 15' x 5' collage ___ Mending Boston ___ which they took to seventeen sites, including Martin Richard's school, Tufts Medical Center, Trinity and Old South Churches, and Spaulding Rehab Center, where more than 250 people were invited to add buildings, parks, life, 'mend' and talk. Mending Boston is permanently installed at Spaulding Rehab Center. This project has led to a series of quilts focusing on animal teachers which are all hand sewn.

I have been an HILR member since the Spring of 2004. Molly and I have co-taught two study groups together at HILR on the Civil Rights Movement. I also co-taught a study group on Communism in America. In all three study groups we ended each class by singing a song of the movement as everyone joined in. I have taken a wide variety of study groups on arts, culture, history, literature, architecture, science and math. I am a member of the Technology Committee and enjoying helping people use technology and thinking about how to make technology more accessible and useful. I love biking or walking to HILR when weather permits. Outside of HILR I am interested in folk singing, English Country Dancing and Contra Dancing, theater ___ going to, not acting in -- and progressive politics. We have five grandchildren ages 12, 17, 20, 23 and 25. Two of them live near us in Cambridge, which is great. I have always been politically active in Civil Rights, Peace and Environmental movements. In 1964, when I was a graduate student in Engineering at Cornell University, I joined a group of about 40 volunteers_mostly from Cornell_who spent the summer in Fayette County Tennessee as part of a voting rights campaign. In September 2007 Molly and I went back to Fayette County to meet some of the County Civil Rights leaders and see how the county had changed over 40-plus years. My career has been in education. I've specialized in math, science and technology education, and I've taught all levels from 4th grade through graduate school. I've also done curriculum and software development, teacher education and professional development, educational research and technical support. I still keep my hand in with some consulting work. Most recently I helped write math curriculum for Alaskan schools based on the traditional mathematical knowledge of Native Alaskan Elders. I've also taught online courses for math teachers for Lesley University, and developed ""math problems of the month"" for the SEED foundation Web Site. I consulted with a Boston area non-profit on developing a professional development ""toolkit"" for middle school math teachers to help them teach students who are English Language learners.

,Peter,,White,,,,,"12 Blanchard Rd.  Cambridge, MA 02138-1009",617-491-7289,thirdparty@comcast.net,,,,,,,"Peter was a Harvard pre-med whose organic chemistry fell prey to rowing, theater and other academic pursuits. A period of discernment followed, during which he earned a degree in microbiology and then switched to architecture, studying design at the GSD. Low income and subsistence housing became a passion and he was caught up in the wave to industrialize the process. He traveled to Mexico and became familiar with squatter communities, attended business school, and worked with an industrialized housing start-up as a hands-on designer, crane operator and construction manager. All too soon there was a recession, Federal funding disappeared, the company went bankrupt, and industrialized housing spiraled in to the abyss. Peter had thought that the problem was technical. It was not. It was social, political and economic. In 1974 Peter partnered with a Harvard urban design professor to found an architectural firm. Growing during the good times and entering design competitions during the bad, Lozano-White established a reputation for excellence in transportation related architecture especially involving projects with complicated circulation and requiring sophisticated engineering coordination. After almost 20 years there was a ""professional divorce"" . Peter consulted for several years in program management and related subjects before joining Harvard Square architectural firm Tsoi Kobus & Associates, where he was construction architect for a wide variety of projects. These included the Mormon Temple on Belmont Hill, the Nine Zero Hotel, some office buildings, and conversion of the Necco Candy factory into a lab for Novartis. During his last years at Tsoi Kobus, he designed and supervised construction of five cancer treatment centers using proton beams. These facilities, costing about $150 million each, bring radiation treatment to difficult tumor sites with less damage to surrounding tissue. They are saving lives. Peter had now come full circle, involved once again in medicine and playing the student with particle physics and radiation biology. He hopes to continue consulting in this area during retirement. What else with the time left? He intends to nurture relationships and explore passions left in the wake of a busy life. He will spend more hours with Susie, his wife of almost 50 years. He will try to better support his 3 adult daughters and 7 grandchildren. His watercolor technique is bound to improve with patience, time and discipline. He will rake through his leaf-pile of fragmentary knowledge and information, study new things, look for some general principles. He will seek ways to wisdom, be thankful, and try to give something back.",,,Art|Biological Science|Business|Climate Change & Ecology|Computer science|Economics|Government & Politics|HILR Curriculum|Medicine|Physical Science|Social Science|Technology|Theatre|Travel

That led to early work in Philadelphia and Baltimore where as a researcher and consultant he immersed himself in issues involving housing and urban renewal.

As a Research Associate at Columbia, he worked on the microwave properties of superconductors and then joined GTE Research Labs in Queens. When GTE moved to a new lab in Waltham, Stan was happy to return to the Boston area. He spent the next 35 years doing research in and publishing papers on the optical properties of materials useful in communications like diode lasers, LEDs, glass fibers and nanometer-sized thin films as well as semiconductors acoustic amplifiers. When GTE headquarters eliminated scientific research following the decontrol of telephone services in the 1990's, Stan spent a few years in telecommunications engineering representing GTE at national Standards Groups which set the functional standards for digital cellular phone service. After retiring he decided to pursue a new interest in computer programming and completed severalCertificates at UMass Lowell. He joined their computer-support department where hedeveloped early modules for online learning and then moved on to MIT to become part of a software development group supporting student requirements for a multitude of web/database interface services. After 13 years at MIT, Stan retired again, this time for good. In his leisure time Stan has been a horseback rider, hiker, and wilderness tripper as well as a participant in online courses on a variety of subjects. He and his wife have enjoyed attending seminars at major theater festivals, touring in foreign countries, taking naturalist courses in National Parks, and ballroom dancing. Stan is looking forward to pursuing new areas of learning especially in natural science and history.",,,Computer science|Film|HILR Curriculum|Physical Science|Social Science|Technology|Theatre

,Sultan,,Zia,,,,,  ,,sultan.zia@gmail.com,,,,,,,"Born and raised in Hyderabad, India, Sultan earned his BS in electrical engineering from Bangalore. In January 1963, he went to Kansas State University to pursue graduate studies. After receiving a master's degree in electrical engineering, Sultan moved to Massachusetts in 1965 and has lived here ever since. Forty years in Massachusetts have certainly made him into a hard core New Englander. Sultan started his career as a design engineer at Honeywell in Waltham and then moved on to a management position at Digital Equipment Corporation in Maynard. During his 30 years at Digital/Compaq, Sultan progressed to vice president of the corporation managing various business entities. During the mid-'80s he took some time off from corporate responsibilities to join the graduate school at INSEAD in France where he studied international management. In early 2001 Sultan retired from Digital/ Compaq to become the CEO of a telecom software company and in October 2003 he decided to retire from corporate life. Sultan and his wife, Farhana, live in Framingham. Both their children, son, Omar, and daughter, Raana, are married and live in Austin, Texas and San Francisco respectively. The Zia family loves to travel and have visited every continent except Antarctica. They ski in winter, play tennis and golf and sail during the rest of the year. Both Sultan and Farhana are very active in the Muslim community in the greater Boston area.",,,Business|French|HILR Curriculum|Literature|Religion|Social Science|Sports|Technology|Travel
,J Adrian,,Zimmer,,,,,  ,,reg@jazimmer.net,,,,,,,"I was raised mostly in Nebraska but spent some of my teenage years in Denmark. My education extended through a postdoc in mathematics before I figured out that I really wanted to be a computer scientist. I retired knowing more about the latter subject. On the way I was able to teach in both high schools and graduate schools. I have lived in Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Ontario, Alberta, Denmark, and Iran. Not much moss on me. During my freshman year in college my favorite subject was anthropology but here's the thing: my math professor pushed me, and had a high opinion of what I could do, whereas my anthropology professor, to the extent that he paid attention at all, thought my ability was no more than average. At that age I tended to listen to my elders more than was good for me. The 60s fixed that. An unusual feature of my personal life, which may seem to contradict my lack of moss, is that I have always lived with blood relatives or a Significant Other. I have two children and four grandchildren.",,,Computer science|HILR Curriculum|Physical Science|Social Science|Technology
