  List of English Stop Words

<http://xpo6.com/author/xpo6/> xpo6 <http://xpo6.com/author/xpo6/> on
April 14, 2009

*Stop Words* are words which do not contain important significance to be
used in Search Queries. Usually these words are filtered out from search
queries because they return vast amount of unnecessary information. A
better definition is provided below:

“Words that do not appear in the index in a particular database because
they are either insignificant (i.e., articles, prepositions) or so
common that the results would be higher than the system can handle (as
in the case of IUCAT where terms such as United States or Department are
stop words in keyword searching.) Stop words vary from system to system.
Also, some systems will merely ignore stop words where use of stop words
in other systems will result in retrieving zero hits. ”

/http://www.iusb.edu/~libg/instruction/helpguide/handouts/2005Boolean.shtml/

Since I needed to use them in a project (Humboldt Diglital Library and
Network <http://www.avhumboldt.net/>), I am posting here a list of
English stop words, and below a PHP array containing these words

Here is a list of english stop words:

Update: Elastic Search has an analyzer that allows you to remove stop
words with ease: See Using Elastic Search Analyzer to remove Stop Words
from a text
<http://xpo6.com/using-elasticsearch-analyzer-remove-stop-words-from-text/>
for some example.

    Thank you James,
    I have corrected it.
    I have noticed someother English-Stop Words.
    At the moment (April 25th, 2009) I have just published an array of
    these, later I plan to create a simple database table and add add
    new ones.

    Great list. Thanks! Putting all of the words in an array saved me a
    lot of time! Just a note: “the” is in the array twice. Once where it
    should be alphabetically, and then again at the end.

    This is sort of a peculiar list of stop words, and seems to serve
    some specialized needs, as opposed to being appropriate for general
    use. For example “computer” “cry”, “detail”, “system”…

    Btw, something is wrong with the email address parsing on this page.
    It is rejecting my completely valid email address. I’d have to guess
    it is because of the . in the name. I’ll try another.

    […] Not bad huh? There are some problems however. First, if the
    title has continuous spaces, the slug will contains continuous
    dashes, which is not quite right. Second, much more important, we
    didn’t take into account a concept called stop words. Long story
    shot, stop words are words that don’t contain important information
    and are often filtered out from search queries by search engines. A
    list of English stop words can be found here. […]
