      Google History

The short stopwords list below is based on what we believed to be Google
<http://www.google.com/> stopwords a decade ago, based on words that
were ignored if you would search for them in combination with another
word. (ie. as in the phrase "a keyword").  Last time we checked using
stopwords in searchterms did matter, results will be different.

We do believe stopwords (and other non-relevant text parts such as
navigation menus) are filtered out of the text by Google and other
search engines to help determine what a page is about.
